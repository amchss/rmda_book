## Main types of validity typically distinguished in research:

 - Measurement Validity

## Measurement Validity

The soundness or appropriateness of a test or instrument or it could be even an indicator to measure a concept, in measuring what it is designed to measure.

## Conventional Paradigms of Validity

 - **Internal validity** 
The best approximation of truth or falsity of a statement implying a relationship or its absence between two variables â€“indicative of causation.

 - **External validity** 
The validity with which we infer that the presumed causal relationships can be generalised to and across alternative measures of the cause and effect and across different types of persons, settings and times.
