# Cornerstones of Credible Research

In the realm of research, the concepts of **validity and reliability** are fundamental to ensuring that our findings are both accurate and trustworthy. Validity refers to the extent to which a study measures what it claims to measure. In other words, it assesses whether the tools and methods used in research accurately capture the intended phenomena. Reliability, on the other hand, pertains to the consistency and stability of those measurements over time. A reliable instrument yields similar results under consistent conditions, reinforcing the credibility of the data.

The significance of these concepts cannot be overstated. Without validity, we risk drawing erroneous conclusions that can misinform policy, practice, or further research. Similarly, without reliability, our results may fluctuate unpredictably, undermining their usefulness. Together, validity and reliability form the backbone of rigorous research, ensuring that our findings contribute meaningfully to knowledge and understanding. We will understand both the concept in detail in this session.
