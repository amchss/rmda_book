# Bias in Research

Bias refers to a **systematic tendency to favor one perspective, outcome, or group over others**, leading to distortion in research, decision-making, or judgment.

In research, bias can result from various factors, including the way studies are designed, how data is collected, and how results are interpreted. This can lead to inaccurate conclusions that do not reflect the true nature of the subject being studied.

## Definitions

- Deviation of results or inferences from the truth, or processes leading to such deviation. Any trend in the collection, analysis, interpretation, publication, or review of data that can lead to conclusions that are systematically different from the truth.

- A process at any stage of inference tending to produce results that depart systematically from true values.                                            


"*The Idols of Tribe have their foundation in human nature itself, and in the tribe or race of men. For it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things. On the contrary, all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe. And the human understanding is like a false mirror, which, receiving rays irregularly, distorts and discolors the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it*."

```         
  - Francis Bacon, Novum Organum
```

Bacon's words remind us that our understanding of the world is influenced by who we are and where we come from. In research, this means our personal biases can affect how we design studies, analyze data, and draw conclusions.
