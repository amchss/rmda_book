# Inferential Statistics

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that allows us to make conclusions about a population based on a sample of data drawn from that population. Unlike descriptive statistics, which focuses on summarizing and describing data, inferential statistics enables researchers to draw conclusions, make predictions, and test hypotheses, making it a crucial tool in various fields, including healthcare, public health, social sciences, and business.

## Population, Sample and Sampling Process

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

Inferential statistics operates on the fundamental idea that we can infer characteristics of a population from a carefully selected sample. Since studying an entire population is often impractical or impossible due to time, cost, or accessibility constraints, researchers rely on samples. The goal is to use the sample data to draw conclusions or make estimates about the larger population.

-   **Population:** This refers to the entire group of individuals or items that we are interested in studying. For example, in a medical study, the population could be all individuals with a certain medical condition.

-   **Sample:** A sample is a subset of the population that is selected for analysis. The sample must be representative of the population to ensure that the inferences made are valid. For example, selecting 500 individuals with the condition from different regions provides a sample from the larger population.

-   **Sampling Process:** The sampling process involves selecting individuals from the population in a way that ensures the sample reflects the population's characteristics.

## Focus Areas

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

In following chapters, we are focusing on three key areas of inferential statistics:

-   Hypothesis Testing

-   Interval Estimation

-   Regression Analysis

Each of these areas plays a crucial role in understanding and applying inferential methods effectively. We will also explore how to implement these concepts using R, providing you with practical tools to analyze data and draw meaningful conclusions.
