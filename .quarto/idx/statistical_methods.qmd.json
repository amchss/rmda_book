The goal of this session is to help you understand the fundamental concepts of biostatistics and the different types of variables used in data analysis. By the end of this session, you will be familiar with these concepts and ready to explore the two key branches of statistics: descriptive and inferential.\n\nBy the end of this chapter, students will:\n\n-   Understand key concepts in biostatistics\n\n-   Be able to differentiate between types of variables\n\n-   Be able to differentiate between the two major parts of statistics: descriptive and inferential analysis\n:::\n\n## Introduction to Biostatistics and Types of Variables\n\n### Biostatistics\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n**Biostatistics** is the application of statistical methods to biological and medical data. It helps clinicians make informed decisions based on data collected from clinical trials, observational studies, and patient records.\n\n### Variables\n\nIf, as we observe a characteristic, we find that it takes on different values in different persons, places, or things, we label the characteristic a variable.\n\nFor example, if we are observing the characteristic'height' in a group of people, we will notice that height varies from person to person. Therefore, height is a variable.\n:::\n\n### Types of Variables\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nVariables are essential in data analysis and are categorized into four types:\n\n![Types of Variables](images/type_of_variable.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n-   **Nominal Variables**: Categorical variables with no inherent order (e.g., blood type: A, B, AB, O).\n\n-   **Ordinal Variables**: Categorical variables with a meaningful order but unequal intervals (e.g., pain scale: mild, moderate, severe).\n\n-   **Discrete Variables**: Numerical variables with distinct, countable values (e.g., number of patients in a clinic).\n\n-   **Continuous Variables**: Numerical variables that can take any value within a range (e.g., patient weight, height).\n:::\n\n### Two Major Parts of Statistics\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nStatistics is divided into two main areas:\n\n1.  **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing and describing data.\n\n2.  **Inferential Statistics**: Making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.\n\nExplore the following session to deepen your understanding of descriptive and inferential statistical methods, as well as how to implement these techniques using R.\n:::\n\n## Descriptive Statistics: Graphical Methods\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nGraphical methods are crucial for understanding data at a glance. Depending on the number and type of variables, we use different graphical techniques. The graphical methods provided here are just some of the available methods for data visualization. There are many others that can be explored in more detail later. This is intended to be a basic introduction to help you get started.\n:::\n\n### Graphical Methods for a Single Variable\n\n+-------------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Variable Type**                   | **Graphical Method** | **Description**                                       |\n+=====================================+======================+=======================================================+\n| **Categorical (Nominal / Ordinal)** | Bar Chart            | Shows frequency or proportion of categories           |\n+-------------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Discrete (Integer)**              | Histogram            | Displays the count of values across defined intervals |\n+-------------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                     | Dot Plot             | Shows individual data points for small datasets       |\n+-------------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Continuous (Double)**             | Histogram            | Shows the frequency distribution of continuous values |\n+-------------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                     | Box Plot             | Displays distribution, including outliers             |\n+-------------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                     | Density Plot         | Visualizes the density function                       |\n+-------------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+\n\n### Graphical Methods for Two Variable Visualization\n\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n|                                     | **Categorical (Nominal / Ordinal)** | Numeric (Discrete / Continuous) |\n+=====================================+=====================================+=================================+\n| **Categorical (Nominal / Ordinal)** | Stacked Bar Chart                   | Box plot                        |\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n| **Numeric (Discrete / Continuous)** | Box plot                            | Scatter Plot                    |\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n\n### Data Visualization Using R: Introduction to Grammar of Graphics\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nData visualization in R can be effectively done using the `ggplot2` package, which is included in the popular `tidyverse` collection of R packages. `ggplot2` is based on the **Grammar of Graphics**, a structured approach that allows you to build plots layer by layer. This grammar provides a framework for describing and creating visualizations by combining different graphical elements. The idea is that any plot can be constructed by breaking it down into components.\n\nThe visualisation using `ggplot2` package, which follows the philosophy of grammar of graphics, breaks down a plot into several components:\n\n-   **Data**: The dataset you're working with.\n\n-   **Aesthetics**: The visual properties (e.g., axes, colors, sizes).\n\n-   **Geometries**: The type of plot (e.g., points, bars, lines).\n\n-   **Facets**: Dividing the data into subplots.\n\n-   **Scales**: Mapping of data values to visual properties.\n\n-   **Coordinates**: How data is projected onto the plane (e.g., Cartesian coordinates).\n\n#### What Happens When You Run `ggplot()`? {.unnumbered}\n\nWhen you run `ggplot()` in R without specifying any further components, it provides you with a blank \"canvas\" (or plane) on which you can build your plot. This is like opening a blank sheet of paper to start drawing. Here's an example:\n\n```{r}\n# Load Packages\n#install.packages(pacman)\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, here)\n\n# Load Data\n\ndf <- read_rds(here(\"data\", \"nhanes_modified_df.rds\"))\n\ndf <- df |> \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\n\n```\n\n```{r}\n\n# Running ggplot without specifying layers\nggplot()\n\n```\n\nThis will simply give you a blank plot. You then need to add layers to specify what the plot will contain.\n:::\n\n#### Aesthetics (aes) {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nAesthetic mappings define how data is mapped to visual properties. They include properties such as:\n\n-   x and y axes: Mapped to variables in your data.\n\n-   color: Used to differentiate categories.\n\n-   size: Used to represent magnitude or importance.\n\nFor example, when you add aesthetics to ggplot(), it tells R how to map data to the plot:\n\n```{r}\n\nggplot(data = df, \n       mapping = aes(x = height, y = weight))\n```\n\nIn this example, `height` is mapped to the x-axis and `weight` to the y-axis\n:::\n\n#### Layers in `ggplot2` {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThe power of `ggplot2` lies in its layering system. After creating the base plot with `ggplot()`, you can add multiple layers.\n\nYou add these layers using the + operator\n\nFor Example:\n\n```{r}\n# Adding layers to create a plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Height vs Weight\",\n       caption = \"Source: NHANES Data\") \n\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of each layer in the example:\n\n-   `ggplot(df, aes(x = height, y = weight))`: This initializes the plot using the `df` dataset. Inside `aes()`, the *x-axis* is mapped to *xvariable (height)*, and the *y-axis* is mapped to *yvariable (weight)*. The aes() function defines aesthetic mappings, determining how data is represented visually.\n\n-   `geom_point()`: This adds a geometric layer, specifically a scatter plot, where each point represents an observation. It visualizes the relationship between x and y\n\n-   `labs(title = \"Height vs Weight\", caption = \"Source: NHANES Data\")`: This layer adds a title and a caption to the plot, making it more interpretable. The title helps to explain what the plot is displaying.\n\nEach layer builds on the previous one, progressively adding more information to the visualization.\n\n***Note***\n\nEvery geometric layer starts with `geom_` in ggplot2.\n:::\n\n### Visualising a Single Variable using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nGraphical methods are essential for summarizing and understanding the distribution of a single variable. In this section, we will explore different types of plots for visualizing one variable, based on its type (nominal, ordinal, discrete, or continuous). The key graphical methods include bar charts, boxplots, histograms, and density plots.\n:::\n\n#### Bar Chart\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nA **bar chart** is used to represent categorical data (nominal or ordinal). Each bar represents the frequency (or count) of a category. It’s commonly used for visualizing nominal variables like race or education level.\n\nExample:\n\n```{r}\n\n# Bar chart example for a nominal variable\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = race)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Bar Chart of Race\", \n    x = \"Gender\", \n    y = \"Count\")\n```\n:::\n\n#### Boxplot\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nA boxplot is used to represent the distribution of a continuous variable. It shows the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.\n\nExample:\n\n```{r}\n# Boxplot example for a continuous variable\nggplot(df, aes(y = height)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Height\")\n\n```\n:::\n\n#### Histogram\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nA histogram is used to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing the data into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin. It’s useful for understanding the shape, spread, and central tendency of continuous variables like age or income.\n\nExample:\n\n```{r}\n# Histogram example for a continuous variable\nggplot(df, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Height\", x = \"Height\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n```\n\nHere the x-axis represents height (a continuous variable), and the y-axis represents the frequency of observations in each height bin.\n\nWe can make the histogram more attractive.\n\n```{r}\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, \n                 fill = \"blue\", \n                 color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Height\", \n       x = \"Height\", \n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n```\n:::\n\n#### Density Plot\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nA density plot is a smoothed version of a histogram, used for continuous data. It provides an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable.\n\n```{r}\n# Density plot example for a continuous variable\nggplot(df, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_density(\n    alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Density Plot of Height\", \n    x = \"Height\") +\ntheme_minimal()\n\n```\n\nWe can represent the area under the curve using any color.\n\n```{r}\n# Density plot example for a continuous variable\nggplot(df, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_density(\n    fill = \"green\", \n    alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Density Plot of Height\", \n    x = \"Height\") +\ntheme_minimal()\n```\n:::\n\n#### Combining Multiple Geometries: Overlaying Histogram and Density Plot\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nOne of the strengths of `ggplot2` is its ability to add multiple geometric shapes (geoms) to a single plot. For example, you can overlay a **density plot** on top of a **histogram** to visualize both the frequency distribution and the smoothed probability distribution of a continuous variable in a single canvas.\n\nExample: Histogram and Density Plot Together\n\n```{r}\n# Combining histogram and density plot\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = height)) +\n  # Histogram with density scaling\n  geom_histogram(\n    aes(y = after_stat(density)),        # Normalize the histogram to show density instead of counts\n    binwidth = 2,                # Sets the bin width for the histogram\n    fill = \"blue\",               # Fills the bars with blue color\n    color = \"black\",             # Outlines the bars with black\n    alpha = 0.6                  # Adds transparency to the bars\n  ) +\n  # Density plot\n  geom_density(\n    aes(y = after_stat(density)),        # Ensures the y-axis of density is consistent\n    color = \"red\",               # The density plot will be red\n    linewidth = 1                     # Thickness of the density line\n  ) +\n  # Labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Histogram and Density Plot of Height\",  # Title for the plot\n    x = \"Height\",                                    # X-axis label\n    y = \"Density\"                                    # Y-axis label\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()                                     # Apply a clean theme\n\n```\n:::\n\n### Visualising Two Variables using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nWhen working with two variables, visualizing the relationship between them helps reveal patterns, associations, or differences. The appropriate plot depends on the types of variables involved (categorical, continuous, or a combination). In this section, we will explore different graphical methods for visualizing two variables: stacked bar charts, grouped bar charts, scatter plots, box plots by category, and regression lines with standard error.\n:::\n\n#### Stacked Bar Chart\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nA **stacked bar chart** is used when both variables are categorical. It displays the distribution of one variable while stacking the bars based on the categories of the second variable.\n\nExample:\n\n```{r}\n# Stacked bar chart example for two categorical variables\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = gender, fill = race)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"stack\") +\n  labs(title = \"Stacked Bar Chart of Gender by Race\", x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", fill = \"Race\")\n```\n:::\n\n#### Grouped Bar Chart\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nA grouped bar chart is another option for visualizing two categorical variables. Instead of stacking the bars, it places bars for each category side-by-side, allowing for a clearer comparison between categories.\n\nExample:\n\n```{r}\n# Grouped bar chart example for two categorical variables\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = race, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Grouped Bar Chart of Gender by Race\", x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", fill = \"Race\")\n\n```\n:::\n\n#### Scatter Plot\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nA scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. Each point on the plot represents an observation, and patterns like clusters, trends, or outliers can be detected.\n\nExample:\n\n```{r}\n# Scatter plot example for two continuous variables\nggplot(df, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Height vs Weight\",\n       caption = \"Source: NHANES Data\")\n\n```\n:::\n\n#### Box Plot by Category\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nA box plot by category is useful when comparing the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories of a categorical variable. It shows the median, quartiles, and potential outliers within each category.\n\nExample:\n\n```{r}\n# Box plot example for a continuous variable by category\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = gender, y = height)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot of Height by Gender\", x = \"Gender\", y = \"Height\")\n\n```\n:::\n\n#### Combining Multiple Geometries: Scatter Plot with Regression Line\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nA scatter plot with a regression line helps visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. Adding a regression line shows the trend, while the standard error (SE) band around the line indicates the uncertainty in the estimate of the relationship.\n\nWhile regression is an inferential method (used for making predictions or understanding relationships), the purpose of this example is to demonstrate how multiple geometries can be combined when visualizing two variables.\n\nExample:\n\n```{r}\n# Scatter plot with regression line and SE\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6) +    # Add scatter plot points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",                   # Add a regression line\n              color = \"red\",                   # Set the color of the line\n              se = TRUE,                       # Add the SE band (uncertainty)\n              fill = \"lightgray\",              # Color of the SE band\n              size = 1) +                      # Set thickness of the line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Scatter Plot with Regression Line and SE Band\",  # Title\n    x = \"Height (cm)\",                                        # X-axis label\n    y = \"Weight (kg)\"                                         # Y-axis label\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()                                              # Apply a clean theme\n\n\n```\n:::\n\n### Visualizing Three Variables using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nWhen working with three variables, we can extend basic plots like scatter plots by adding a third variable as an aesthetic element such as color or fill. This allows us to represent more dimensions of the data in a single plot. One common approach is to use **color** to represent a categorical or continuous variable in a scatter plot.\n\nExample: Scatter Plot with Color for a Third Variable\n\nIn this example, we'll create a scatter plot of two continuous variables and use color to represent a third categorical variable. This can help identify patterns or groupings based on the third variable.\n:::\n\n#### Example {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r}\n# Scatter plot with color representing a third variable\n\nggplot(df, \n       aes(x = height, \n           y = weight, \n           color = race)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of Height vs Weight by Race\", \n       x = \"Height\", y = \"Weight\", color = \"Race\")\n\n```\n\n**Another Way**\n\n```{r}\n# Scatter plot with color representing a third variable\n\nggplot(df, \n       aes(x = height, \n           y = weight)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n    facet_wrap(~race)+\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of Height vs Weight by Race\", \n       x = \"Height\", y = \"Weight\", color = \"Race\")\n\n```\n\n### Visualizing Four Variables using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nTo visualize four variables, we can use a combination of **color** (or fill) for the third variable and **facet wrapping** for the fourth variable. Facet wrapping creates a series of smaller plots based on the levels of a categorical variable, allowing us to compare the relationships across different subgroups.\n\nExample: Scatter Plot with Color and Facet Wrap\n\nIn this example, we'll use a scatter plot with color representing a third variable, and facet wrapping to display different plots for each level of the fourth variable.\n\n```{r}\n# Scatter plot with color and facet wrap for a fourth variable\nggplot(df, \n       aes(x = height, \n           y = weight,\n           color = gender)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n    facet_wrap(~race)+\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of Height vs Weight by Race and gender\", \n       x = \"Height\", y = \"Weight\", color = \"Gender\")\n```\n:::\n\n## Descriptive Statistics: Numerical Methods\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nWelcome to the world of numerical descriptive methods! These techniques are your go-to tools for exploring data and understanding key concepts like distribution, central tendency, and variability. Think of them as helpful signs that guide you in figuring out how your data works.\n\nThese methods can be broadly categorized into two key areas: [measures of central tendency](https://www.nios.ac.in/media/documents/SecMathcour/Eng/Chapter-25.pdf) and [measures of dispersion](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3198538/). Both are crucial for painting a comprehensive picture of your data. However, we won’t be diving too deeply into these measures in this section; you can read more about them through the provided links. Instead, let’s consider something important: the choice of summary measures depends on the type of variable you’re working with. Whether you're dealing with categorical variables (like nominal and ordinal data) or numeric variables (which can be discrete or continuous), different summary statistics come into play.\n\n![Image by pikisuperstar on Freepik](images/descriptive_stat.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"300\"}\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n### Types of Variables and Summary Measures\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nSo, what exactly should you use when analyzing your data? Let’s break it down!\n:::\n\n#### Numerical Methods for a Single Variable\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nWhen you're focusing on just one variable, numerical methods allow you to summarize and analyze your data through various statistical measures. For numeric variables, you can explore measures of central tendency like the mean, median, and mode. These give you a glimpse into the typical values of your dataset. But that's not all—measures of dispersion, such as standard deviation, variance, and range, tell you how spread out your data is.\n\nAnd don’t forget about categorical variables! For nominal and ordinal data, you can utilize frequency, proportion, and percentage to get a clearer picture of your dataset.\n\nHere’s a handy table to summarize the types of variables and their corresponding summary measures:\n:::\n\n+-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Type of Variable**                    | **Summary Measures**                                     |\n+=========================================+==========================================================+\n| **Categorical (Nominal / Ordinal)**     | Frequency, Proportion, Percentage, Cumulative proportion |\n+-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Numeric** **(Discrete / Continuous)** | Measures of Central Tendency,                            |\n|                                         |                                                          |\n|                                         | Measures of Dispersion                                   |\n+-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n<br>\n\n#### Numerical Methods for Two Variable\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nWhen you’re analyzing two variables, the methods you choose will depend on the types of variables involved. If you're working with categorical variables, like nominal and ordinal, you might find yourself comparing frequencies or proportions.\n\nBut when numeric variables enter the equation, you've got a whole new set of tools at your disposal. Think correlation and comparing means—these methods help you uncover relationships and differences between the variables, bringing you closer to understanding the data dynamics at play.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of some of the choices available to you:\n:::\n\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------+\n| **Type of Variables**               | **Nominal**       | **Ordinal**          | **Numeric (Discrete / Continuous)** |\n+=====================================+===================+======================+=====================================+\n| **Nominal**                         | Cross-tabulation  |                      |                                     |\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------+\n| **Ordinal**                         | Cross-tabulation, | Cross-tabulation,    |                                     |\n|                                     |                   |                      |                                     |\n|                                     |                   | Spearman correlation |                                     |\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------+\n| **Numeric (Discrete / Continuous)** | Compare means     | Spearman correlation | Correlation                         |\n+-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------+\n\n<br>\n\n### Numerical Methods for a Single Variable using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nAs we mentioned earlier, there are various ways to describe variables based on their types. In this section, we’ll explore how to describe different variables using R. First, we’ll look at numerical variables (both discrete and continuous), and then we’ll dive into categorical variables (nominal and ordinal).\n\n\n:::\n\n#### Describing a Single Numerical (Discrete / Categorical) Variable using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nNow, let’s explore how to describe numerical variables. We can use various measures, including mean, median, range, standard deviation, interquartile range, and percentiles.\n:::\n\n##### Mean\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThe mean is the average of all the data points.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Calculate the mean\ndf |> \n  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))\n\n```\n\n**Another Way**\n\n```{r}\ndf |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  mean()\n```\n\nWhat does `df |> pull(age)` means. Try yourself!\n\nNow lets find the mean height.\n\n```{r}\n\ndf |> \n  summarise(mean_height = mean(height))\n\n```\n\n**Why does the mean height show NA?**\n\nWhen you try calculating the mean of the height variable, you might notice that it returns NA. This happens because some individual observations for height have missing values (NA).\n\nTo solve this, we need to tell R to ignore those missing values when performing the calculation. For this, we use an additional argument in the `mean()` function: `na.rm = TRUE`. This argument stands for “remove NAs,” and when set to `TRUE`, it ensures the missing values are ignored, allowing R to calculate the mean based on the available data.\n\n```{r}\n# Calculate the mean while having NA values\n\ndf |> \n  summarise(\n    mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)\n    )\n\n\n```\n\nBy adding this small argument, you’ll get the correct mean without being tripped up by missing data!\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n##### Median\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThe median is the middle value when the data is ordered.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Calculate the median\ndf |> \n  summarise(median_age = median(age))\n\n\ndf |> \n  summarise(median_height = median(height, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n```\n\nTry finding median using `pull` function from the `dplyr` package.\n\n<br>\n:::\n\n##### Range\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThe range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Calculate the range\n\ndf |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  range()\n\ndf |> \n  pull(height) |> \n  range(na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n```\n\nIf you want to find the maximum and minimum values separately, you can do this:\n\n```{r}\n\n# Calculate the Maximum\n\ndf |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  max()\n\n\n# Calculate the Minimum\n\ndf |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  min()\n\n\n```\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n##### Standard Deviation\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nStandard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a variable.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\n\n# Calculate the standard deviation\ndf |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  sd()\n\ndf |> \n  pull(height) |> \n  sd(na.rm = T)\n\n```\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n##### Percentiles\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nPercentiles indicate the relative standing of a value within the dataset.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Calculate specific percentiles (e.g., 25th and 75th percentiles)\n\ndf |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  quantile(probs = 0.25)\n\n\ndf |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  quantile(probs = 0.75)\n\n\ndf |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  quantile(probs = c(0.25, 0.75))\n\n\n\n```\n\n<br>\n:::\n\n##### Inter Quartile Range\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThe IQR is the range between the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3).\n\n```{r}\n\n# Calculate the IQR\ndf |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  IQR()\n\n\n```\n\nThere’s another way to approach this. We can estimate the third quartile, which represents the 75th percentile, and the first quartile, which corresponds to the 25th percentile. By calculating the difference between these two values, we arrive at the interquartile range (IQR).\n\n```{r}\n\n# Calculate the IQR\n\nq_1 <- df |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  quantile(probs = 0.25)\n\n\nq_3 <- df |> \n  pull(age) |> \n  quantile(probs = 0.75)\n\n\nq_3 - q_1\n\n```\n:::\n\n##### Combining Multiple Summary Measures\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nIf you want to combine multiple measures as a single outcome, it is also possible.\n\n```{r}\ndf |> \n  summarise(\n    min_age = min(age),\n    q1_age = quantile(age, prob = 0.25), \n    mean_age = mean(age),\n    median_age = median(age), \n    q3_age = quantile(age, prob = 0.75),\n    max_age = max(age)\n  )\n```\n\n<br>\n:::\n\n#### Describing a Single Categorical (Nominal / Ordinal) Variable using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nNow let’s dive into categorical variables! When working with categorical data, we often summarize it using frequencies (how often each category appears), percentages (what proportion of the total each category makes up), and cumulative percentages (the running total of those percentages). Let’s explore how to do all of this in a tidy way using R.\n\nWe’ll continue working with the NHANES dataset to see this in action.\n\n<br>\n:::\n\n##### Frequency\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nFrequency tells us how many times each category appears in the data. Let’s calculate the frequency for the marital status variable (`marital_status`).\n\n```{r}\n# Calculate the frequency of each category in 'hh_income'\n\nmarital_status_frequency <- df |> \n  count(marital_status)\n\nmarital_status_frequency\n\n```\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n##### Percent\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nNext, we’ll calculate the percentage for each category, which shows the relative proportion of each category within the dataset.\n\n```{r}\n# Calculate the percentage for each category in 'marital_status'\n\nmarital_status_percent <- df |> \n  count(marital_status) |>  \n  mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100)\n\nmarital_status_percent\n\n```\n\n<br>\n:::\n\n##### Cumulative Percent\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nCumulative percent shows the running total of percentages, which can help understand the distribution across categories as you move through them.\n\n```{r}\n# Calculate cumulative percentage for 'hh_income'\n\nmarital_status_cumulative <-  df |>\n  count(marital_status) |>  \n  mutate(percent = n / sum(n) * 100,\n         cumulative_percent = cumsum(percent))\n\nmarital_status_cumulative\n\n```\n:::\n\n#### Publication Ready Tables\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nTo create publication-ready tables, you can use the `gtsummary` package in R. Here’s an example of how to generate a summary table for a single variable dataset:\n\n```{r}\n\n# Install and load the gtsummary package if not already installed\n\n# install.packages(\"gtsummary\")\n\npacman::p_load(gtsummary)\n\n# Create a summary table for the dataset\nsummary_table <- df |> \n  select(age, gender, race, height) |> \n  tbl_summary(\n    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ \"{mean} ({sd})\", \n                     all_categorical() ~ \"{n} ({p}%)\"),\n    digits = all_continuous() ~ 2\n  )\n\n# Print the table\nsummary_table\n\n\n```\n\nTry `df |> tbl_summary` without selecting variables.\n:::\n\n### Numerical Methods for Two Variables using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nIn this section, we’ll dive into how to describe relationships between two variables using R. Depending on the types of variables—categorical or numeric—the methods vary. We’ll cover three main scenarios:\n\n-   Two categorical variables\n\n-   Two numeric variables\n\n-   One categorical and one numeric variable\n:::\n\n#### Two Categorical Variables\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nWhen working with two categorical variables, one of the most common ways to analyze the relationship between them is by using cross-tabulation.\n\nCross-tabulation creates a **contingency table** that shows the frequency distribution for each combination of categories.\n\nLet’s use the `gender` and `race1` variables in the NHANES dataset to explore this.\n:::\n\n##### Cross-Tabulation\n\n```{r}\n\n# Cross-tabulation of 'gender' and 'race1'\ngender_race_table <- df %>%\n  count(gender, race)\n\ngender_race_table\n\n```\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThis table shows how the categories of gender and race1 are distributed across each other. But to make this even more informative, let’s add percentages.\n:::\n\n##### Cross-Tabulation with Percentages\n\n```{r}\n# Cross-tabulation with percentages\ngender_race_percent <- df %>%\n  count(gender, race) %>%\n  group_by(gender) %>%\n  mutate(percent = n / sum(n) * 100)\n\ngender_race_percent\n\n```\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThis output gives us a clearer picture of the relationship between the two categorical variables by showing the percentage of each race within each gender group.\n:::\n\n#### Two Numeric Variables\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nWhen both variables are numeric, we can correlation to explore the relationship between them.\n:::\n\n##### Correlation\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nCorrelation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two numeric variables. The most common measure is Pearson’s correlation coefficient.\n\nLet’s calculate the correlation between `height` and `weight`.\n\n```{r}\ndf %>%\n  drop_na(height, weight) |> \n  summarise(correlation = cor(height, weight))\n```\n\n**Another Way**\n\n```{r}\n# Correlation between height and weight\ndf %>%\n  summarise(correlation = cor(height, weight, use = \"complete.obs\"))\n\n```\n\nHere, `use = \"complete.obs\"` ensures that rows with missing values (NA) are ignored during the correlation calculation, just like `na.rm = TRUE` would do.\n:::\n\n#### One categorical and One Numeric Variables\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nWhen you have one categorical and one numeric variable, you’re often interested in comparing the distribution of the numeric variable across different categories. Group-wise summaries and box plots are common methods for this.\n\nLet’s look at the relationship between gender (categorical) and height (numeric).\n\nGroup-Wise Summaries We can calculate summary statistics (like mean and median) for height within each gender category.\n:::\n\n```{r}\n# Group-wise summary of height by gender\ndf %>%\n  group_by(gender) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE),\n    median_height = median(height, na.rm = TRUE),\n    sd_height = sd(height, na.rm = TRUE),\n    iqr_height = IQR(height, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n```\n\n#### Publication Ready Tables for Two Variables\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nWhen you need to present results in a polished, publication-ready format, the gtsummary package in R is an excellent tool. It allows you to easily create clean, professional tables summarizing relationships between two variables. Below is an example of how you can use gtsummary to generate a table for a two-variable analysis, showcasing how your results can be made ready for publication.\n\n```{r}\n\n\n# Create a publication-ready table for two categorical variables\ntable_cat <- df %>%\n  select(gender, race) %>%\n  tbl_summary(by = gender, \n              label = race ~ \"Race/Ethnicity\") \n\n# Display the table\ntable_cat\n\n```\n\nIf you're comparing a numeric variable across categories (e.g., height by gender), use the `tbl_summary()` function with the `by` argument.\n\n```{r}\n\n\n# Create a publication-ready table for a categorical and a numeric variables\n\ntable_cat_num <- df  |> \n  select(gender, height) |> \n  drop_na() |> \n  tbl_summary(by = gender, \n              label = height ~ \"Height\") \n\n# Display the table\ntable_cat_num\n\n```\n\nIf you need mean and standard deviation instead of median and IQR, then\n\n```{r}\ntable_cat_num <- df  |> \n  select(gender, height) |> \n  drop_na() |> \n  tbl_summary(\n    by = gender,\n    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ \"{mean} ({sd})\")\n  ) \n\n# Display the table\ntable_cat_num\n```\n:::\n\n## Inferential Statistics\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nInferential statistics is a branch of statistics that allows us to make conclusions about a population based on a sample of data drawn from that population. Unlike descriptive statistics, which focuses on summarizing and describing data, inferential statistics enables researchers to draw conclusions, make predictions, and test hypotheses, making it a crucial tool in various fields, including healthcare, public health, social sciences, and business.\n:::\n\n### Population, Sample and Sampling Process\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nInferential statistics operates on the fundamental idea that we can infer characteristics of a population from a carefully selected sample. Since studying an entire population is often impractical or impossible due to time, cost, or accessibility constraints, researchers rely on samples. The goal is to use the sample data to draw conclusions or make estimates about the larger population.\n\n-   **Population:** This refers to the entire group of individuals or items that we are interested in studying. For example, in a medical study, the population could be all individuals with a certain medical condition.\n\n-   **Sample:** A sample is a subset of the population that is selected for analysis. The sample must be representative of the population to ensure that the inferences made are valid. For example, selecting 500 individuals with the condition from different regions provides a sample from the larger population.\n\n-   **Sampling Process:** The sampling process involves selecting individuals from the population in a way that ensures the sample reflects the population's characteristics.\n:::\n\n![Image modified from [\"Research Methods for the Social Sciences: An Introduction](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/jibcresearchmethods/chapter/7-2-population-versus-samples/)\" (2020) by Valerie Sheppard.](images/pop_sample.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Focus Areas\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nIn following chapters, we are focusing on three key areas of inferential statistics:\n\n-   Hypothesis Testing\n\n-   Interval Estimation\n\n-   Regression Analysis\n\nEach of these areas plays a crucial role in understanding and applying inferential methods effectively. We will also explore how to implement these concepts using R, providing you with practical tools to analyze data and draw meaningful conclusions.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Inferential Statistics: Hypothesis Testing and Interval Estimation\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nIn inferential statistics, hypothesis testing and interval estimation are core methods used to make conclusions about a population from sample data. While hypothesis testing determines if there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis, interval estimation provides a range of values (confidence intervals) likely to contain the true population parameter. Together, these tools form the basis of statistical inference.\n\nIn this chapter, we explore hypothesis testing and interval estimation for various scenarios using R, including means, proportions, and categorical variables. We focus on practical implementation and provide references for more in-depth theoretical understanding. For a more in-depth understanding, refer to additional resources.\n\n-   [Hypothesis testing, type I and type II errors](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996198/): This paper explores the essentials of hypothesis testing in research, covering characteristics and types of hypotheses, statistical principles, type I and type II errors, effect size, alpha and beta, statistical power, and p-values [@banerjee2009].\n\n-   [Hypothesis Tests](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7807926/pdf/main.pdf): This article aims to provide readers with a clear understanding of the purpose of hypothesis testing, guidance on selecting the appropriate test for various research scenarios using a reference table, and insights into interpreting p-values effectively [@walker2019].\n\n-   [Using the confidence interval confidently](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5723800/pdf/jtd-09-10-4125.pdf): The paper discusses the application and significance of confidence intervals (CIs) in biomedical research, particularly for estimating population parameters based on sample data. It outlines the process of calculating CIs, noting that the margin of error depends on sample variability, sample size, and confidence level. The authors highlight how CIs provide more meaningful insights than p-values alone by offering an estimated range for effect size, which is crucial for assessing clinical relevance. [@hazra2017]\n:::\n\n### Hypothesis Testing and Interval Estimation for a Mean\n\n#### One-Sample T-Test: Hypothesis Testing\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nThe one-sample t-test is a statistical method that compares the mean of a sample to a known reference value—usually a population mean—to assess if there is a significant difference. \n\nIn this context, using the NHANES dataset, we can investigate whether the mean blood pressure (BP) of a sample of adults differs significantly from the standard \"normal\" BP value, which is often considered to be around 120 mmHg for systolic pressure.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n\n**Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The mean systolic blood pressure of the sample is equal to the normal value (120 mmHg).\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: The mean systolic blood pressure of the sample differs from 120 mmHg.\n\n**R Implementation**: We’ll use the `t.test()` function to conduct the one-sample t-test, specifying 120 as the value for comparison.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Conduct a one-sample t-test\nt_test_result <- t.test(df$bp_sys, mu = 120, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# View the result\nt_test_result\n\n\n```\n\n**Interpretation of Results:**\n\n-   t-Statistic: 4.0396\n\n-   Degrees of Freedom: 5451\n\n-   p-value: 5.427e-05\n\n\n**Conclusion**: With a p-value of <0.0001 (below 0.05), we conclude that the sample’s average blood pressure of  120.9503 mmHg is statistically different from the normal BP value of 120 mmHg. However, for clinicians, it’s essential to think about what this small difference actually means for patient care.\n\nIn this case, while there’s a statistically significant difference, the 0.9503 mmHg increase from the standard value is likely too small to have clinical importance. This reminds us that even if a result is statistically significant, it’s the practical impact on patient outcomes that ultimately matters.\n\n:::\n\n#### One-Sample T-Test: Interval Estimation\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nIn addition to hypothesis testing, we also estimate a confidence interval (CI) for the mean systolic blood pressure of the sample. The confidence interval provides a range of values that likely contains the true mean systolic blood pressure of the population.\n\n**95% Confidence Interval Calculation:**\n\nFrom our one-sample t-test results, we can compute the 95% confidence interval for the mean blood pressure:\n\n- 95% Confidence Interval for Mean BP: (120.4891, 121.4115)\n\n- Sample Mean: 120.9503 mmHg\n\nThe confidence interval indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true mean systolic blood pressure of the population lies between 120.4891 mmHg and 121.4115 mmHg. This information is particularly valuable in clinical practice, as it not only provides an estimate of the mean but also conveys the degree of uncertainty around that estimate.\n\nWhile the average blood pressure of 120.9503 mmHg is statistically significant, the width of the confidence interval suggests that there is little variability in our estimate, reinforcing the notion that this slight increase from the standard value may lack clinical importance.\n\nUltimately, this dual approach—hypothesis testing combined with interval estimation—allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the data and its implications for patient care. \n\n:::\n\n### Hypothesis Testing and Interval Estimation for Two Means\n\n\n#### Two-Sample T-Test: Hypothesis Testing\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nThe two-sample t-test is a statistical method used to compare the means of two independent groups. In this context, we will examine whether there is a significant difference in height between males and females using the NHANES dataset.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n\n**Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$): There is no difference in the mean height between males and females.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_1$): : There is a difference in the mean height between males and females.\n\n**Conduct the Test in R**: Assuming we have loaded and cleaned the NHANES dataset, we can perform the two-sample t-test on height.\n\n```{r}\n# Conduct two-sample t-test for height difference between males and females\nt_test_height <- t.test(height ~ gender, data = df, var.equal = TRUE)\n\n# View the results\nt_test_height\n\n```\n\nIn the t.test() function in R, the argument var.equal = TRUE specifies that we assume the two groups have equal variances. By default, the two-sample t-test in R does not assume equal variances (this is called Welch's t-test). When var.equal = TRUE, we perform a pooled two-sample t-test, where the variances from each group are combined (or \"pooled\") to estimate a common variance.\n\n**Interpretation of Results**\n\n-   t-Statistic: -69.721\n\n-   Degrees of Freedom (df): 5630\n\n-   p-value: \\< 0.0001\n\n\n**Conclusion:** The very low p-value (\\< 0.05) indicates that we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is a statistically significant difference in average height between males and females in this sample.\n:::\n\n#### Two-Sample T-Test: Confidence Interval\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nIn addition to hypothesis testing, it is important to calculate the confidence interval for the difference in means to provide further context regarding the effect size.\n\n**95% Confidence Interval for the Difference in Means:**\n\n**Confidence Interval:** (-14.23, -13.45)\nThis interval suggests that males are, on average, between 13.45 and 14.23 cm taller than females.\n\n**Interpretation of the Confidence Interval:**\n\n- 95% Confidence Interval for the Difference in Means: (-14.23, -13.45)\n\n- Sample Means: \n\n  + Female: 161.75 cm \n  + Male: 175.59 cm\n  \n  \nThe confidence interval provides a range of values that, with 95% confidence, includes the true difference in average height between males and females. Since the entire interval is negative, this reinforces our earlier conclusion that males are significantly taller than females.\n\n:::\n\n#### Paired T-Test: Hypothesis Testing\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nThe paired t-test is a statistical method used to compare two related samples, measuring the same group at two different times.\n\nFor example, to examine the effect of an intervention, a paired t-test can be used to compare blood pressure (BP) measurements taken pre- and post-intervention among individuals with a BMI greater than 25. \n\nThe paired t-test is ideal for dependent samples, where each individual has measurements in both conditions (pre and post), allowing us to assess whether the intervention significantly impacted BP.\n\nFor the paired t-test examining blood pressure changes before and after an intervention among individuals with a BMI over 25, the hypotheses can be outlined as follows:\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n\n**Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$): The mean systolic blood pressure before the intervention is equal to the mean blood pressure after the intervention for individuals with a BMI greater than 25. This implies that the intervention had no effect on blood pressure.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_1$): The mean systolic blood pressure before the intervention is different from the mean blood pressure after the intervention for individuals with a BMI greater than 25, suggesting a potential effect of the intervention on blood pressure.\n\nIf the test results in a p-value less than our significance threshold (typically 0.05), we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in blood pressure, likely attributable to the intervention.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Filter the dataset for individuals with BMI > 25\ndf_filtered <- df |> \n  filter(bmi > 25)\n\n# Run a paired t-test\nt_test_result <- t.test(\n  df_filtered$bp_sys_post,\n  df_filtered$bp_sys,\n  paired = TRUE)\n\n# Display the result\nt_test_result\n\n\n```\n\n**Paired t-Test Results Interpretation**\n\n\n- t-statistic: -132.99\n\n- Degrees of Freedom (df): 3683\n\n- p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\n\nThe t-statistic is -132.99, indicating a significant difference in systolic blood pressure (BP) between the average pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements.The degrees of freedom is 3683, indicating a large sample size, which adds robustness to the statistical findings.\n\nThe p-value is \\< 2.2e-16, which is extremely low and suggests a statistically significant difference in systolic blood pressure before and after the intervention. Since this p-value is well below the standard threshold of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a meaningful change in BP levels. \n\n\n#### Paired T-Test: Confidence Interval\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is (-4.582318, -4.449170). This interval indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true mean decrease in systolic blood pressure lies between -4.58 mmHg and -4.45 mmHg. Since the entire interval is negative, this strongly supports the conclusion that the intervention has led to a significant reduction in systolic BP.\n\nThe mean difference in systolic blood pressure is approximately -4.515744 mmHg, suggesting that, on average, individuals with a BMI greater than 25 experienced a decrease of about 4.52 mmHg in systolic BP following the intervention.\n\nThe results of the paired t-test indicate that the intervention was effective, resulting in a statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure among individuals with a BMI greater than 25. The average decrease of 4.52 mmHg is both statistically significant and clinically relevant. \n\n:::\n\n\n### Hypothesis Testing and Interval Estimation for a Proportion\n\nNow we cover the concepts of hypothesis testing and interval estimation for proportions. \n\n#### Hypothesis Testing for a Proportion\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nOur research question is:\n\n*Is the prevalence of diabetes in the adult  population equal to 10%?*\n\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n\n**Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$): The proportion of individuals with diabetes in the adult population is equal to 20% (i.e., $p = 0.10$).\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_1$): The proportion of individuals with diabetes in the adult population is not equal to 20% (i.e., $p \\neq 0.10$).\n\n**Conducting the Test in R**\n\n```{r}\n\ndiabetes_count <- df |> \n  drop_na(diabetes) |> \n  filter(diabetes == \"Yes\") |> \n  nrow()\n\ntotal_count <- df |> \n  drop_na(diabetes) |>  \n  nrow()\n\nprop.test(diabetes_count, total_count, p = 0.10, conf.level = 0.05)\n\n\n```\n\nhere\n\n- `prop.test()`: Conducts a one-sample proportion test to check if the observed proportion of diabetes cases `(diabetes_count/total_count)` significantly differs from the hypothesized proportion (p).\n\n- `p = 0.10`: Specifies the null hypothesis proportion (10% in this case).\n\n- `conf.level = 0.95`: Sets the confidence level for the interval estimate around the observed proportion. A 95% confidence level means we are 95% confident that the interval contains the true population proportion.\n\n**Interpretation of Results**\n\nWith a p-value of 0.05891, which is slightly above the typical significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there isn’t sufficient evidence to suggest that the proportion of individuals with diabetes in the population is different from 10%.\n\nIn a clinical context, this suggests that the observed prevalence of diabetes in the sample aligns closely with the expected prevalence, and no significant deviation is observed.\n\n:::\n\n#### Confidence Interval for a Proportion\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nInterpretation of Confidence Interval\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the proportion of individuals with diabetes in the population is approximately (0.1073, 0.1080). This interval suggests that we can be 95% confident that the true proportion of individuals with diabetes lies between 10.73% and 10.80%.\n\nThis finding supports the conclusion from the hypothesis test, as the confidence interval is close to the specified null value of 10%, reinforcing that the prevalence of diabetes in the population remains stable and aligns with expectations.\n\n:::\n\n\n### Chi-Squared Test\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThe chi-squared test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. By comparing the observed frequency distribution of categories with the expected distribution (assuming no association), the test evaluates whether the variables are independent of each other or if there is an association. This test is particularly useful in analyzing relationships in large datasets with categorical data, like survey responses or patient characteristics.\n\nAs an example, we’ll use the chi-squared test to examine whether there is an association between BMI category and diabetes status among adults in our dataset.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n\n**Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$): There is no association between BMI category and diabetes status (BMI and diabetes status are independent).\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_1$): There is an association between BMI category and diabetes status.\n\n**Data Preparation**\n\nEnsure that the bmi_who and diabetes variables are factors:\n\nIf not then make it factor variable.\n\n```{r}\nclass(df$bmi_who)\n\nclass(df$diabetes)\n```\n\nBoth variables are factor.\n\n**Creating a Contingency Table in Tidy Format**\n\nTo perform a chi-squared test, we first need a contingency table that shows the counts of individuals in each combination of bmi_who and diabetes categories.\n\n```{r}\n# Create contingency table in tidy format\ncontingency_table <- table(df$bmi_who, df$diabetes)\n\n```\n\n**Performing the Chi-Squared Test**\n\nTo assess whether an association exists between BMI category and diabetes, we apply the chi-squared test as follows:\n\n```{r}\n# Conduct the chi-squared test\nchi_test <- chisq.test(contingency_table)\n\n# View the test results\nchi_test\n\n\n```\n\n**Interpretation of Chi-Squared Test Results**\n\n-   Chi-Squared Statistic (X-squared): 169\n\n-   Degrees of Freedom (df): 3\n\n-   p-value: \\< 2.2e-16\n\nSince the p-value is extremely small (less than 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a statistically significant association between BMI category and diabetes status. This suggests that diabetes prevalence differs across BMI categories in our sample.\n\nHowever, while statistical significance tells us there is an association, it does not reveal the direction or strength of the relationship. To determine the strength and direction—such as whether higher BMI categories are positively associated with increased diabetes risk—you could perform a regression analysis.\n\nFor binary outcomes like diabetes status, logistic regression would be a suitable approach. It would allow us to model the probability of diabetes as a function of BMI categories while providing insights into how each category impacts the likelihood of diabetes, as reflected by odds ratios. This approach also enables adjustments for potential confounders, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship.\n:::\n\n### One-way ANOVA\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nOne-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used to compare the means of more than two groups to determine if at least one group mean differs significantly from the others. This method is suitable when we have a categorical independent variable (factor) with multiple levels and a continuous dependent variable. For example, we could use one-way ANOVA to test if the average blood pressure differs across BMI categories.\n\nAs an example, we’ll use the one-way ANOVA To determine if average systolic blood pressure varies across BMI categories.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n\n**Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$): The average systolic blood pressure is the same across all BMI categories.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_1$): The average systolic blood pressure differs for at least one BMI category.\n\n```{r}\n# Fit the ANOVA model\nanova_model <- aov(bp_sys ~ bmi_who, data = df)\n\n# View the summary\nsummary(anova_model)\n\n```\n\n**Interpretation of One-Way ANOVA Results**\n\n-   **Degrees of Freedom (Df)**: The degrees of freedom for the BMI categories is 3, meaning there are four BMI groups. The residual degrees of freedom is 5379, accounting for the total sample size minus the number of groups.\n\n-   **Sum of Squares (Sum Sq)**: This indicates the variability within each group (Residuals) and between the groups (BMI categories). A larger Sum of Squares for the BMI groups relative to the residuals suggests substantial variation in systolic blood pressure due to BMI category.\n\n-   **Mean Squares (Mean Sq)**: This is the Sum of Squares divided by the respective degrees of freedom. The larger Mean Square for BMI groups indicates a larger variability attributed to BMI categories compared to random error.\n\n-   **F-value**: The F-value of 30.75 is substantial, suggesting that the variation in systolic blood pressure between the BMI categories is much greater than within each category.\n\n-   **p-value (\\< 2e-16)**: The extremely small p-value is well below 0.05, leading us to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in systolic blood pressure among the different BMI categories in this sample.\n\nSince the ANOVA indicates a significant difference, a post-hoc analysis (such as Tukey's HSD) could be conducted to identify which BMI categories specifically differ from each other in terms of average systolic blood pressure.\n:::\n\n## Inferential Statistics: Regression Analysis\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nRegression analysis is a powerful statistical method used to examine the relationship between two or more variables. The goal of regression is to understand how the dependent variable (also called the outcome or response variable) changes when one or more independent variables (also known as predictors or explanatory variables) are varied This method is widely used in various fields such as economics, healthcare, social sciences, and engineering to make predictions, identify trends, and uncover relationships between variables.\n\nThere are various types of regression, each suited to different types of data and research questions. Some common types include:\n\n-   **Linear Regression:** This examines the relationship between one independent variable and one or more dependent variables, assuming a linear relationship between them.\n\n-   **Logistic Regression:** Used when the dependent variable is categorical, typically binary (e.g., success/failure). It models the probability of the outcome occurring.\n\n-   **Generalized Linear Models (GLM):** These extend linear regression to handle various types of dependent variables, including count data and proportions, using different link functions. Both linear regression and logistic regression are actually special cases of GLMs. Linear regression uses an identity link function for continuous outcomes, while logistic regression uses a logit link function for binary outcomes. This flexibility makes GLMs a versatile tool for modeling a wide range of data types.\n\n-   **Generalized Mixed Models (GLMM):** A more advanced approach that handles both fixed and random effects, useful for dealing with hierarchical or clustered data, and when the data structure involves more complex relationships.\n\nIn this session, we will focus on two important types of regression: linear regression and logistic regression, and demonstrate how to perform them in R.\n:::\n\n### Simple Linear Regression\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nSimple Linear regression (SLR) is one of the most widely used statistical methods for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable. However, to ensure the model's accuracy and validity, several assumptions must be met.\n:::\n\n#### Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThe acronym **LINE** helps us remember the key assumptions needed for making inferences and predictions with models based on linear least squares regression (LLSR).\n\nIn the case of simple linear regression with a single predictor $X$, the assumptions are as follows:\n\n-   **L (Linear relationship)**: The mean of the response variable $Y$ is linearly related to the predictor variable $X$.\n\n-   **I (Independence of errors)**: The errors (or residuals) are independent, meaning that the distance between any two points from the regression line is unrelated.\n\n-   **N (Normal distribution)**: For each value of $X$, the response $Y$ is normally distributed.\n\n-   **E (Equal variance)**: The variance (or standard deviation) of the responses is constant for all values of $X$.\n\nThese assumptions can be illustrated visually:\n\n![Assumptions for linear least squares regression (LLSR) [(Roback and Legler, 2021)](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-MLRreview.html#assumptions-for-linear-least-squares-regression)](images/linear_regression.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n-   L: The expected value of $Y$ at each $X$ lies along the regression line.\n\n-   I: We should verify that the design of the study ensures the errors are independent.\n\n-   N: The values of $Y$ are normally distributed at each level of $X$.\n\n-   E: The spread of $Y$ is consistent across all levels of $X$.\n:::\n\n#### The Simple Linear Regression Model\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nIn SLR, the goal is to model the relationship between a dependent variable (response) and an independent variable (predictor). The model predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variable, helping us understand how changes in one variable impact the other.\n\nThe general form of a simple linear regression model is:\n\n$$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon$$\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $Y$ is the dependent variable (the outcome we are predicting).\n\n-   $X$ is the independent variable (the predictor).\n\n-   $\\beta_0$ is the intercept (the expected value of $Y$ when $X=0$).\n\n-   $\\beta_1$ is the slope (the change in $Y$ for each unit increase in $X$).\n\n-   $\\epsilon$ is the error term, representing the variability in $Y$ not explained by $X$.\n:::\n\n#### Interpreting the Model\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n-   **Intercept (**$\\beta_0$): The intercept tells us the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. However, in some cases, like the relationship between height and weight, interpreting the intercept might not make practical sense (e.g., predicting weight when height is zero).\n\n-   **Slope (**$\\beta_1$): The slope indicates the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. For example, if we are looking at the relationship between height and weight, the slope tells us how much weight is expected to increase (or decrease) for every unit increase in height.\n\n-   **Error term (**$\\epsilon$): The error term captures the variation in the dependent variable that is not explained by the independent variable. In practice, our model won’t perfectly predict every observation, and this error term accounts for the difference between observed values and the values predicted by the model.\n:::\n\n### Simple Linear Regression Using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nIf the assumptions of simple linear regression are met, we can proceed with fitting the model to the data. In this section, we will explore how to perform simple linear regression using R. This method allows us to examine the relationship between a dependent variable (response) and an independent variable (predictor) and make predictions based on the data.\n:::\n\n#### Simple Linear Regression with a Numeric Independent Variable\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nWhen dealing with a numeric independent variable, simple linear regression helps us understand how changes in the independent variable affect the dependent variable. In R, we can easily fit and evaluate this relationship using the lm() function.\n\nHere’s an example of performing simple linear regression when the independent variable is numeric:\n\n**Research Question**\n\nUsing the NHANES dataset, our research question is:\n\nIn adults, is there a relationship between height (independent variable) and weight (dependent variable)?\n:::\n\n**Data Wrangling**\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nBefore we perform the Simple Linear Regression, we need to load and clean the NHANES dataset.\n:::\n\n```{r}\n# Instal and load packages\n\n#install.packages(pacman)\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, broom)\n\n\n# Load Data\n\ndf <- NHANES::NHANES\n\ndf <- df |> \n  filter(Age >= 18)\n\n# Set \"White\" as the reference category directly using factor()\ndf <- df |> \n  mutate(Race1 = factor(Race1, levels = c(\"White\", \"Black\", \"Mexican\", \"Hispanic\", \"Other\")))\n\n\n\n# Clean names\n\ndf <- df |> \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\ndf <- df |> \n  rename(race = race1)\n```\n\n**SLR Model**\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nNow, we build the linear regression model to examine the relationship between height and weight in adults.\n:::\n\n```{r}\nmodel <- lm(weight ~ height, data = df)\n\nsummary(model)\n\n\ntidy(model)\n```\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n-   The `lm()` function fits a simple linear regression model, and `summary()` provides detailed results including the regression coefficients, $R^2$, and p-values.\n\n-   The `tidy()` function from the `broom` package organizes the model output in a tidy format.\n:::\n\n**SLR Model Interpretation**\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThe Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model fits the relationship between height and weight in the adult population from the NHANES dataset. Below is a breakdown of the model output:\n\n**Model Equation**\n\nThe general form is\n\n$$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X$$\n\nThe model equation based on the output can be written as:\n\n$$\\text{Weight} = -78.07 + 0.95 \\times \\text{Height}$$\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted weight (in kg)\n\n-   The intercept (-78.07) represents the predicted weight when height is zero, which doesn’t have a practical interpretation in this context but is mathematically part of the model.\n\n-   The slope (0.95) indicates that for each additional unit of height (in cm), the weight is expected to increase by approximately 0.95 kg, on average.\n\n**Coefficients**\n\n-   Intercept (-78.07): The negative intercept is not practically meaningful since height cannot be zero in adults, but it is part of the linear equation.\n\n-   Height (0.95): The slope suggests that for every additional centimeter in height, weight increases by about 0.95 kg on average. The very small p-value ($<2e^-16$) indicates that the effect of height on weight is highly statistically significant.\n\n**Residuals**\n\nThe residuals show the differences between the observed and predicted values of weight:\n\n-   The minimum residual is -41.33, and the maximum is 149.02, indicating some large deviations.\n\n-   The median residual is -2.89, suggesting that most predictions are close to the observed values.\n\n**Goodness of Fit**\n\n**R-squared (0.2025)** Approximately 20.25% of the variance in weight is explained by height, which suggests that while height has a significant impact on weight, other factors also influence weight substantially.\n\n**Adjusted R-squared (0.2024)** Very close to the R-squared, confirming the model is reliable for this data.\n\n**Model Significance**\n\nThe F-statistic (1882) and its corresponding p-value (\\<2.2e−16) indicate that the model is highly significant, meaning height is a useful predictor for weight in this dataset.\n\nThe interpretation shows that height has a positive and significant relationship with weight, but the relatively low $R^2$ value suggests that other factors besides height influence weight.\n:::\n\n#### Simple Linear Regression with a Categorical Independent Variable\n\nWhen dealing with a categorical independent variable, simple linear regression can be used to analyze how the different categories influence the dependent variable. In this case, we'll explore the relationship between height and race in adults using the NHANES dataset.\n\n**Research Question**\n\nIs there an association between race and weight in adult individuals from the NHANES dataset?\n\n**SLR Model**\n\nIn this analysis, we treat race as a categorical variable and examine its relationship with weight The regression equation for a categorical independent variable will include dummy coding (where one category is taken as the reference).\n\nHere’s how you can perform the simple linear regression with a categorical variable in R:\n\n```{r}\n# SLR Model with Categorical Independent Variable\nmodel_cat <- lm(weight ~ race, data = df)\n\nsummary(model_cat)\n\n# Tidying the output for better interpretation\ntidy(model_cat)\n\n```\n\n**SLR Model Interpretation**\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nThe Simple Linear Regression (SLR) model fits the relationship between race and weight in the adult population from the NHANES dataset. Below is a breakdown of the model output:\n\n**Model Equation**\n\n$$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{(Group1)} + \\beta_2 \\text{(Group2)} + \\dots + \n\\\\ \\beta_k \\text{(Group\\(k\\))}$$\n\nThe model equation based on the output can be written as:\n\n$$\\hat{y} = 82.53 + 5.36 \\times \\text{(Black)} - 1.91 \\times \\text{(Mexican)} -\n\\\\ 4.27 \\times \\text{(Hispanic)} - 9.50 \\times \\text{(Other)}$$\n\n**Coefficients**\n\n-   **Intercept:** The estimated average weight for individuals in the reference category (White) is 82.53 units.\n\n-   `raceBlack`: Black individuals have an average weight that is 5.36 units heavier than the reference category (White).\n\n-   `raceMexican`: Mexican individuals weigh, on average, 1.91 units less than the reference category (White).\n\n-   `raceHispanic`: Hispanic individuals have an average weight that is 4.27 units less than the reference category (White).\n\n-   `raceOther`: Individuals in the Other category weigh, on average, 9.50 units less than the reference category (White).\n\n**Residuals**\n\nResiduals indicate the differences between observed and predicted weights. They range from a minimum of -48.79 to a maximum of 142.81, showing variability in model predictions.\n\n**Goodness of Fit**\n\n-   **Residual standard error:** 21.02, indicating the average distance between observed and predicted values.\n\n-   **Multiple R-squared:** 0.02501, meaning that approximately 2.5% of the variability in weight is explained by race.\n\n-   **Adjusted R-squared:** 0.02448, which adjusts for the number of predictors in the model.\n:::\n\n### Multiple Linear Regression using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\nMultiple linear regression expands on simple linear regression by incorporating multiple independent variables (predictors) to predict the outcome variable (dependent variable). This approach allows us to analyze how each predictor contributes to the outcome, while controlling for other variables.\n\nThe general form of a multiple linear regression model with k predictors,\n\n$$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_k X_k + \\epsilon$$\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $Y$: Dependent variable\n\n-   $X_1, X_2,...,X_k$: Independent variables (predictors)\n\n-   \\$ \\beta\\_0\\$: Intercept (the expected value of $Y$ when all $X$ variables are zero)\n\n-   $,  \\beta_1,  \\beta_2, ...,  \\beta_k$: Coefficients for each independent variable, indicating the expected change in $Y$ for a one-unit change in that variable, holding other variables constant.\n\n-   $\\epsilon$: Error term (the difference between the observed and predicted values)\n\n**Research Question**\n\nIs there an association between height and race (independent variables) with weight in adult individuals from the NHANES dataset?\n\n```{r}\n# multiple linear regression model \n\nmodel_mult <- lm(weight ~ height + race, data = df)\n\nsummary(model_mult)\n\n# Tidying the output for better interpretation\ntidy(model_mult)\n```\n\n**Model**\n\n$$\\text{Weight} = -78.35 + 0.946 \\times \\text{Height} + 6.333 \\times \\text{raceBlack}$$ $$2.847 \\times \\text{raceMexican} + 1.233 \\times \\text{raceHispanic} - $$ $$5.369 \\times \\text{raceOther}$$\n\nLet’s analyze the case of an individual with certain characteristics (height and race)\n\n-   For a Black Individual:\n\n-   Height: 175 cm\n\nRace: Black (which is coded as 1 in the model, while other races are coded as 0)\n\n$$Weight = − 78.35 + 0.946 × 175 + 6.333 × 1 + 2.847 × 0 + 1.233 × 0 − 5.369 × 0$$ $$Weight = − 78.35 + 165.55 + 6.333 = 93.533 kg$$\n\nTherefore, the estimated average weight for a Black individual who is 175 cm tall is approximately 93.53 kg.\n\nFor a White Individual:\n\nHeight: 175 cm Race: White (which is coded as 0 in the model) Plugging these values into the model:\n\n$$Weight = − 78.35 + 165.55 = 87.20 kg$$\n\nTherefore, the estimated average weight for a White individual who is 175 cm tall is approximately 87.20 kg.\n\nIn addition, we observe that the coefficient for the Hispanic category is not statistically significant (p = 0.199), suggesting that, for this model, being Hispanic does not have a statistically significant impact on weight compared to the reference category (White) when controlling for height. This lack of significance indicates that the model does not provide evidence of a meaningful difference in weight between White and Hispanic individuals at the same height within this dataset.\n:::\n\n### Logistic Regression using R\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nIn this book, we’re providing a basic introduction to performing logistic regression using R, without diving deeply into the underlying concepts. For readers interested in a more detailed exploration of logistic regression, please refer to [(Harris, 2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8710907/pdf/fmch-2021-001290.pdf).\n\nIn the following example, we aim to address the following research question:\n\n\"Is there an association between age, BMI category, and the likelihood of diabetes in the adult population from the dataset?\"\n\nThis logistic regression model will help determine if age and BMI classification (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity) are significant predictors of diabetes status, providing insights into factors contributing to diabetes risk in the study population.\n\n\n```{r}\n\nmodel_logistic <- glm(diabetes ~ age + bmi_who, data = df,\n    family = \"binomial\")\n\n```\n\n\nTo get the summary of the model\n\n```{r}\nsummary(model_logistic)\n```\n\n\n**The Model Equation**\n\nThe logistic regression model equation for predicting the log-odds of diabetes is:\n\n$$\\log\\left(\\frac{1 - P(\\text{diabetes})}{P(\\text{diabetes})}\\right) = -6.66 + 0.056 \\times \\text{age} + 0.679 \\times \\text{BMI}_{18.5-24.9} + $$ \n$$1.188 \\times \\text{BMI}_{25.0-29.9} + 2.089 \\times \\text{BMI}_{30.0+}$$\n\n**Interpretation**\n\n\nFor a more intuitive interpretation, we can exponentiate the coefficients to convert them from log-odds to odds ratios, making it easier to discuss the association between each predictor and the likelihood of diabetes.\n\nCode for Odds Ratio Conversion\nTo compute the odds ratios along with confidence intervals for each coefficient:\n\n```{r}\nOR <- exp(coef(model_logistic)) # odds ratio\n\nor_ci <- exp(confint(model_logistic)) # Confidence Interval of odd ratio\n\nresult <- data.frame(\n  OR = OR,\n  CI = or_ci\n)\n\nresult <- result |> \n  rownames_to_column(var = \"Variable\") |> \n  as_tibble()\n\nresult\n\n```\n\n\nHere’s a summary of the interpretation based on the odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals:\n\n- **Intercept**: The intercept represents the baseline odds of having diabetes when all predictors are at their reference levels (age = 0 and BMI <18.5). The odds are very low at 0.00128, indicating a low baseline risk in the reference group.\n\n- **Age**: With an odds ratio of 1.06 (95% CI: 1.05 to 1.06), each additional year of age is associated with a 6% increase in the odds of having diabetes, assuming all other factors remain constant. The confidence interval is narrow and above 1, suggesting a statistically significant effect of age on diabetes risk.\n\n- **BMI Category (18.5–24.9)**: This group has an odds ratio of 1.97 (95% CI: 0.707 to 8.21) compared to the reference category (presumably BMI < 18.5). The CI is wide and includes 1, suggesting that this effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels. This indicates that adults in the BMI 18.5–24.9 category may have an increased risk, but this finding is uncertain.\n\n- **BMI Category (25.0–29.9)**: The odds ratio for this category is 3.28 (95% CI: 1.19 to 13.6), indicating that individuals in this BMI range have approximately 3.28 times the odds of having diabetes compared to the reference group. The confidence interval does not include 1, suggesting this result is statistically significant.\n\n- **BMI Category (30.0+)**: With an odds ratio of 8.08 (95% CI: 2.95 to 33.4), individuals with a BMI over 30 have over 8 times the odds of having diabetes compared to the reference group. The confidence interval is well above 1, indicating a strong and statistically significant association between a high BMI and increased diabetes risk.\n\n:::\n\n### Summary {.unnumbered}\n\n:::
