# Epidemiological Study Designs

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
The goal of this session is to introduce different study designs used in epidemiology, understand their strengths and limitations and thereby equip us to choose appropriate designs for various research questions.
:::

## What is a 'Study Design' ?

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
-   A framework, or a set of methods and procedures used to collect and analyze data on variables specified in a particular research problem.

-   A strategy, a direction to follow, in order that your objective is achieved or the question you ask is answered.

-   A specific plan or protocol for conducting the study, which allows the investigator to translate the conceptual hypothesis into an operational one.
:::

## What determine the type of Study Design?

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
-   The nature of question

-   The goal of research

-   The availability of resources
:::

## Study designs: Broad categorisation

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
-   Observational Study Design

-   Experimental Study Design

The above links will take you to each of the study design and its characteristics, while to have a quick differentiation of the two, here is a table summarising the key points.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

df <- data.frame("Characteristics" = c("Definition", "Control", "Generalisable", "Feasibility"),
"Observational Study" = c("Observes & measures variables without manipulating them", "Limited control over extraneous variables or confounders","May not be generalised","Less expensive, less time consuming, easy to conduct"),
"Experimental Study" = c("Manipulates the variables to determine their effect on another", "Strict control over variables by process of randomisation", "May be generalised","Expensive, time consuming, complex conduct"))

## Observational Study Design

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
An observational study is a type of research design where researchers observe and analyze subjects without manipulating any variables. This approach allows for the examination of real-world conditions and associations between exposures (such as risk factors or interventions) and outcomes (like diseases or behaviors) in a natural setting.

### Types of Observational Study Design

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
Broadly observational study designs are categorised as two:

-   Descriptive Study Designs
-   Analytical Study Designs

### Descriptive Observational Study Design

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
Descriptive study design is a research methodology that aims to provide a detailed account of a population, phenomenon, or event. Unlike experimental designs, which seek to establish causal relationships through manipulation of variables, descriptive studies focus on painting a comprehensive picture of the characteristics and conditions as they exist in real life.
:::

#### The Primary Goal of Descriptive Studies

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
To describe the characteristics of a population or phenomenon. This includes gathering information about demographics, behaviors, attitudes, or conditions without influencing or altering them.
:::

#### Limitations of Descriptive Studies

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
While descriptive studies provide essential insights, they do not establish causal relationships. They are limited by the absence of manipulation of variables, which means that findings must be interpreted with caution.
:::

```

First let us delve into the individual level descriptive studies.
:::

**Case Reports**

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
A case report is a detailed account of a specific clinical instance involving an individual patient. It serves as one of the earliest forms of medical research, emerging from the **careful observations** made by physicians and healthcare providers during their clinical practice. It serves as valuable tool for generating hypotheses, particularly in emerging health issues, as they document unique clinical presentations and associations.They provide detailed accounts of individual patient experiences, which can inform clinical practice and enhance understanding of rare or novel conditions.

-   Simplest study design

-   Hypothesis generating tool

-   Detailed presentation of a single case, new or unfamiliar diseases, rare manifestations

Generally report a new or unique finding

-   previous undescribed disease

-   unexpected link between diseases

-   unexpected new therapeutic effect

-   adverse event
:::

**Case Series**

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
-   Experience of a group of patients with a similar diagnosis

-   Cases may be identified from a single source or from multiple sources

-   Generally report on new/unique condition

-   May be only realistic design for rare disorders

-   Suffers from the absence of a comparison group

The emergence of the Zika virus in Latin America marked a significant public health concern, particularly due to its association with serious fetal anomalies, including microcephaly. Case reports and case series played a crucial role in elucidating the relationship between Zika virus infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes, significantly enhancing our understanding of this public health crisis.

A case report that first documented instance of maternal Zika virus infection associated with fetal microcephaly in Colombia, mirroring presentations previously observed in Brazil during the 2015--2016 outbreak is presented [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5470308/)
:::

**Ecological Studies**

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
-   Group as the unit of analysis

-   No individual-level information

-   Relate whether populations with high rates of disease also have high frequency of the suspected exposure

-   Comparison of groups than individuals

**Why do Ecological study?**

-   Low cost and convenience

-   Some measurements cannot be made on individuals S

-   implicity of analyses and presentation

-   Helpful in generating new hypothesis

**Key Issues with Ecological studies**

-   Explores correlation between aggregate exposure and outcome

-   Unit of analysis: Group or clusters

-   Prone to ecological fallacy

-   Missing data

-   Cannot adjust to confounding

**Ecological Fallacy**

-   Drawing inference at an individual level based on a group level data

-   Arises when associations between two variables at group level differ from associations between analogous variables measured at the individual level
:::

### Analytical Observational Study Design

::: {style="text-align:justify"}

An analytical observational study design is a type of research method used to investigate relationships between variables and test hypotheses. Unlike descriptive observational studies, which simply describe phenomena as they naturally occur, analytical studies aim to analyze the association or correlation between exposures (or risk factors) and outcomes (or diseases), often to uncover patterns or test causal hypotheses. However, these studies still do not involve manipulation of the study variables, which distinguishes them from experimental designs.
:::
#### Key Features of Analytical Observational Study Design
::: {style="text-align:justify"}
-   Aims to analyze relationships between variables, such as how a certain exposure (e.g., smoking, air pollution, or diet) affects the risk of an outcome (e.g., lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, or obesity).

-   As with all observational study designs, there is no manipulation of the variables by the researcher. The study simply observes the natural occurrence of exposure and outcomes.

-   Test specific hypotheses about associations between exposures and outcomes. These studies aim to identify whether there is a statistical relationship and how strong that relationship might be.

-   While causal inference is stronger in experimental designs (like randomized controlled trials), analytical observational studies can suggest causal relationships if the study is well-designed and the findings are consistent with other evidence.

#### Cross Sectional Study Design
::: {style="text-align:justify"}
A cross-sectional study design involves observing a snapshot of a population at a single point in time, providing a "cross-section" view of both exposures and outcomes simultaneously. In this design, data on the presence or absence of specific outcomes (such as disease or health conditions) and exposures (such as risk factors or behaviors) are collected at the same moment, allowing researchers to examine the relationship between the two. 
The unit of observation and analysis in a cross-sectional study is typically the individual, with researchers collecting information from each participant to assess disease burden and prevalence. Cross-sectional studies are often used to measure prevalence, as they provide a clear picture of how common a particular outcome or exposure is within a population at that specific point in time. These studies can also assess the presence of one or more outcomes and exposures, enabling researchers to explore associations and identify patterns or trends. However, because the data is collected at a single point, cross-sectional studies cannot establish causal relationships, but they are valuable for generating hypotheses and understanding the current state of health or disease in a population.
:::

##### Uses of Cross Sectional Study Design

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
Cross-sectional studies are widely used in public health and epidemiology for various purposes due to their ability to provide a snapshot of a population at a single point in time. Some of the key uses of cross-sectional studies include:

- **Estimating Prevalence of Disease or Risk Factors**: Cross-sectional studies are ideal for determining the prevalence of diseases or health conditions, as they allow researchers to measure the proportion of individuals affected by a particular disease or exposed to a risk factor within a defined population at a specific point in time.

- **Distribution of Health Problems by Time, Place, and Person**: These studies help in understanding how health problems vary across different populations based on characteristics such as age, gender, geographical location, or socioeconomic status. By examining the distribution, researchers can identify groups at higher risk or areas of concern.

- **Planning Health Care Services Delivery**: Cross-sectional data is valuable for health planners and policymakers to assess the current burden of disease and identify areas where health services are needed most. This information can guide the allocation of resources and the development of targeted health interventions.

- **Setting Priorities for Disease Control**: By understanding the prevalence of various diseases or risk factors, cross-sectional studies help prioritize public health efforts and control measures. For example, if a certain disease is found to be widespread, it may prompt immediate action or intervention to mitigate its spread.

- **Generating Hypotheses**: While cross-sectional studies cannot establish causality, they are useful for generating hypotheses about possible associations between exposures and outcomes. These hypotheses can then be tested in more rigorous experimental or longitudinal studies.

- **Examining Evolving Trends**: Cross-sectional studies, especially when repeated over time, can reveal evolving trends in health patterns, disease prevalence, or risk factors within a population. This can help track changes and shifts in public health concerns.

- **Before/After Surveys**: Cross-sectional studies can also be used to assess the impact of interventions or changes in policy by comparing the health status of a population before and after an event or intervention, even if they are not longitudinal in nature.

- **Iterative Cross-Sectional Studies**: Conducting cross-sectional studies in a series or on a rotating basis allows researchers to capture temporal changes and track shifts in population health, risk factors, or disease burden over time without the need for a continuous follow-up.

In summary, cross-sectional studies are versatile tools for understanding the health landscape at a particular moment, guiding public health decisions, and providing insights into the relationships between exposures and outcomes. However, they are primarily observational and cannot infer causal relationships between variables.
:::
#### Case Control Study Design
::: {style="text-align:justify"}
An observational study design commonly used to identify risk factors for a disease or outcome. This design is particularly effective for investigating **rare diseases or outcomes** because it starts by identifying individuals who have the disease (cases) and comparing them to individuals who do not have the disease (controls). The key focus is to assess the prior exposure history of both groups to determine if specific risk factors are more common in the cases than in the controls.

##### Key Steps in Case-Control Study:

- **Identifying Cases and Controls**:

**Cases**,individuals who have the disease or outcome of interest.
**Controls**,individuals who do not have the disease but are otherwise similar to cases in terms of demographic characteristics (age, gender, etc.) and other relevant factors, except for the presence of the disease.

- **Comparing Prior Exposure History**:

The main objective is to compare the frequency of exposure to a specific risk factor among the cases and controls. For example, researchers might look at whether individuals who have lung cancer (cases) were more likely to have smoked (exposure) than individuals who do not have lung cancer (controls). Data is typically collected retrospectively, often through interviews or medical records, to determine the exposure history prior to the development of the disease.

- **Assessing the Effect of Exposure**:
The study examines how often the exposure is present among the cases and controls. If the exposure is significantly more frequent among the cases compared to the controls, it may suggest a potential association between the exposure and the disease. For example, if smoking is much more common among those with lung cancer (cases) than among those without it (controls), smoking could be identified as a potential risk factor for lung cancer.

- **Effect vs. Cause**:
In a case-control study, it is important to differentiate between association and causation. While the study may reveal that a particular exposure (e.g., smoking) is more common among those with the disease, it does not prove that the exposure causes the disease. The observed effect (association) could be influenced by other confounding factors, such as genetic predisposition, environmental factors, or biases in recall (e.g., patients with the disease may be more likely to remember or report past exposures). Establishing causality requires more rigorous evidence from other study designs, such as cohort studies or randomized controlled trials.

- **Comparison of Exposure Frequency**:
The core analysis in a case-control study involves comparing the frequency of exposure in the two groups:
Cases (those with the disease) vs. Controls (those without the disease).

If a higher percentage of cases were exposed to a certain risk factor than controls, this may indicate a potential association between the exposure and the outcome. 

The odds ratio (OR) is a common statistical measure used to quantify this association in case-control studies, indicating how much more likely cases are to have been exposed compared to controls.
