# Exploring Data with R

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

To recap what we learnt in the previous sessions.. we now know to work within the R Project environment. `here::here()` makes it easy for us to manage file paths. You can quickly have a look at your data using the `View()` and `glimpse()` functions. Most of the tidy data is read as `tibble` which is a workhorse of `tidyverse`.

![It is here::here() is better than setwd()](images/setwd_here.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

![here::here() allows us to filepaths very easily](images/here.jpg){fig-align="center" width="300"}

:::

## Getting Started with the Data Exploration Pipeline

### Set-up


```{r}
#install.packages("pacman")


pacman::p_load(tidyverse, here)

#tidyverse required for tidy workflows
#rio required for importing and exporting data
#here required for managing file paths
```

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

*Note*

*The shortcut for code commenting is `Ctrl+Shift+C`.*

### Load Data


> The dataset we will be working with has been cleaned (to an extent) for the purposes of this workshop. It is a dataset about NHANES that has been took from the `NHANES` and cleaned up and modified for our use. 


```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Check the file path
here::here("data", "nhanes_modified_df.rds")

# Read Data
df <- read_rds(here("data", "nhanes_modified_df.rds"))

```

Try the following functions using tb as the argument:

-   `glimpse()`
-   `head()`
-   `names()`

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#| include: false
#| eval: false


# tb

glimpse(df)

head(df)

names(df)
```

Now, we will be introducing you to two new packages:

1.  `dplyr`
2.  `skimr`
3.  `DataExplorer`

:::

## `dplyr` Package

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

The `dplyr` is a powerful R-package to manipulate, clean and summarize unstructured data. In short, it makes data exploration and data manipulation easy and fast in R.

![](images/dplyr.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

There are many verbs in `dplyr` that are useful, some of them are given here...

![Important functions of the dplyr package to remember](images/dplyr_fns.JPG){fig-align="center" width="300"}

![Syntax structure of the dplyr verb](images/dplyr-verb.png){fig-align="center" width="280"}

:::

### Getting used to the pipe `|>` or `%>%`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

![The pipe operator in dplyr](images/dplyr-pipe.png){fig-align="center" width="280"}

*Note*

*The pipe `|>` means THEN...*

*The pipe is an operator in R that allows you to chain together functions in `dplyr`.*

Let's find the bottom 50 rows of tb without and with the pipe.

*Tips* The native pipe \|\> is preferred.

```{r}
#| eval: false

#without the pipe
tail(df, n = 50)

#with the pipe
df |> tail(n = 50)
```

Now let's see what the code looks like if we need 2 functions. Find the unique age in the bottom 50 rows of df

```{r}
#| eval: false

#without the pipe
unique(tail(df, n = 50)$age)

# with the pipe
df |> 
  tail(50) |>
  distinct(age)
```

*Note*

*The shortcut for the pipe is `Ctrl+Shift+M`*

You will notice that we used different functions to complete our task. The code without the pipe uses functions from base R while the code with the pipe uses a mixture (`tail()` from base R and `distinct()` from `dplyr`). Not all functions work with the pipe, but we will usually opt for those that do when we have a choice.

:::

### `distinct()` and `count()`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

The `distinct()` function will return the distinct values of a column, while `count()` provides both the distinct values of a column and then number of times each value shows up. The following example investigates the different race (`race`) in the `df` dataset:

```{r}
#| eval: false

df |> 
  distinct(race) 

df |> 
  count(race)
```

Notice that there is a new column produced by the count function called `n`.

:::

### `arrange()`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

The `arrange()` function does what it sounds like. It takes a data frame or tbl and arranges (or sorts) by column(s) of interest. The first argument is the data, and subsequent arguments are columns to sort on. Use the `desc()` function to arrange by descending.

The following code would get the number of times each race is in the dataset:

```{r}
#| eval: false

df |> 
  count(race) |> 
  arrange(n)

# Since the default is ascending order, 
# we are not getting the results that are probably useful, 
# so let's use the desc() function
df |> 
  count(race) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))

# shortcut for desc() is -
df |> 
  count(race) |> 
  arrange(-n)
```

:::


### `filter()`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

If you want to return **rows** of the data where some criteria are met, use the `filter()` function. This is how we subset in the tidyverse. (Base R function is `subset()`)

![](images/dplyr_filter.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

Here are the logical criteria in R:

-   `==`: *Equal to*
-   `!=`: *Not equal to*
-   `>`: *Greater than*
-   `>=`: *Greater than or equal to*
-   `<`: *Less than*
-   `<=`: *Less than or equal to*

If you want to satisfy *all* of multiple conditions, you can use the "and" operator, `&`.

The "or" operator `|` (the vertical pipe character, shift-backslash) will return a subset that meet *any* of the conditions.

Let's see all the data for age 60 or above

```{r}
#| eval: false

df |> 
  filter(age >= 60)
```

Let's just see data for white

```{r}
#| eval: false

df |> 
  filter(race == "White")
```

Both White and age 60 or more 

```{r}
#| eval: false

df |> 
  filter(age >= 60 & race == "White")
```


### `%in%`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

To `filter()` a categorical variable for only certain levels, we can use the `%in%` operator.




Let's see data from India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh First we will have to figure out how those are spelled in this dataset. Open the spreadsheet viewer and find out. We'll see a way to find them in code later on in the course.

Ok, so we figured out that they are spelled:

-   "India"
-   "Nepal"
-   "Pakistan"
-   "Bangladesh"

Now we'll create a vector of countries we are interested in

```{r}
indian_subcont <- c("India",
           "Nepal",
           "Pakistan",
           "Bangladesh")
```

And use that vector to `filter()` `tb` for countries `%in%` `indian_subcont`

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |> filter(country %in% indian_subcont)
```

You can also save the results of a pipeline. Notice that the rows belonging to Indian Subcontinent are returned in the console. If we wanted to do something with those rows, it might be helpful to save them as their own dataset. To create a new object, we use the `<-` operator.

```{r}
#| eval: false

indian_subcont_tb <- tb |> filter(country %in% indian_subcont)
```

:::

### `drop_na()`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

The `drop_na()` function is extremely useful for when we need to subset a variable to remove missing values.

Return the tb dataset without rows that were missing on the hiv_incidence_100k variable

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |> drop_na(hiv_incidence_100k)
```

Return the tb dataset without any rows that had an NA in any column. \*Use with caution because this will remove a lot of data

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |> drop_na()
```

:::

### `select()`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

Whereas the `filter()` function allows you to return only certain *rows* matching a condition, the `select()` function returns only certain *columns*. The first argument is the data, and subsequent arguments are the columns you want.

See just the country, year, incidence_100k columns

```{r}
#| eval: false

# list the column names you want to see separated by a comma
tb |>
  select(country, year, incidence_100k)
```

Use the - sign to drop these same columns

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |>
  select(-country, -year, -incidence_100k)
```

:::

### `select()` helper functions

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

The `starts_with()`, `ends_with()` and `contains()` functions provide very useful tools for dropping/keeping several variables at once without having to list each and every column you want to keep. The function will return columns that either start with a specific string of text, ends with a certain string of text, or contain a certain string of text.

```{r}
#| eval: false


# these functions are all case sensitive
tb |>
  select(starts_with("percent"))

tb |>
  select(ends_with("r"))

tb |>
  select(contains("_"))

# columns that do not contain -
tb |>
  select(-contains("_"))
```

:::

### `summarize()`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

The `summarize()` function summarizes multiple values to a single value. On its own the `summarize()` function doesn't seem to be all that useful. The dplyr package provides a few convenience functions called `n()` and `n_distinct()` that tell you the number of observations or the number of distinct values of a particular variable.

*Note* *`summarize()` is the same as `summarise()`*

Notice that summarize takes a data frame and returns a data frame. In this case it's a 1x1 data frame with a single row and a single column.

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |>
  summarize(mean(hiv_percent))

# watch out for nas. Use na.rm = TRUE to run the calculation after excluding nas.
tb |>
  summarize(mean(hiv_percent, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The name of the column is the expression used to summarize the data. This usually isn't pretty, and if we wanted to work with this resulting data frame later on, we'd want to name that returned value something better.

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |>
  summarize(hiv_percent = mean(hiv_percent, na.rm = TRUE))
```

:::

### `group_by()`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

We saw that `summarize()` isn't that useful on its own. Neither is `group_by()`. All this does is takes an existing data frame and converts it into a grouped data frame where operations are performed by group.

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |>
  group_by(year)

tb |>
  group_by(year, who_region)
```

:::

### `group_by()` and `summarize()` together

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

The real power comes in where `group_by()` and `summarize()` are used together. First, write the `group_by()` statement. Then pipe the result to a call to `summarize()`.

Let's summarize the mean incidence of tb for each year

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(mean_inc = mean(incidence_100k, na.rm = TRUE))

#sort the output by descending mean_inc
tb |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(mean_inc = mean(incidence_100k, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(desc(mean_inc))
```

:::

### `mutate()`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

Mutate creates a new variable or modifies an existing one.

![](images/dplyr_mutate.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

Lets create a column called `ind_sub` if the country is in the Indian Subcontinent.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# use our vector indian_subcont that we created before
tb |> 
  mutate(indian_sub1 = if_else(country %in% indian_subcont, 
                              "Indian Subcontinent", "Others"))
```

The same thing can be done using `case_when()`.

```{r}
#| eval: false


tb |> 
  mutate(indian_sub2 = case_when(country %in% 
                                   indian_subcont ~ 
                                   "Indian Subcontinent",
                           TRUE ~ "Other")) 
```

Lets do it again, but this time let us make it 1 and 0, 1 if it is a country in the Indian Subcontinent, 0 if otherwise.

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |> 
  mutate(indian_sub3 = case_when(country %in% indian_subcont ~ 1,
                           TRUE ~ 0))
```

![](images/dplyr_case_when_sm.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

*Note*

*The `if_else()` function may result in slightly shorter code if you only need to code for 2 options. For more options, nested `if_else()` statements become hard to read and could result in mismatched parentheses so `case_when()` will be a more elegant solution.*

As a second example of `case_when()`, let's say we wanted to create a new population variable that is low, medium, or high.

See the pop broken into 3 equally sized portions

```{r}
#| eval: false


quantile(tb$pop, prob = c(.33, .66))
```

*Note*

*See the help file for `quanile` function or type `?quantile` in the console.*

We'll say:

-   low pop = 2043237 or less
-   med pop = between 2043237 and 11379155
-   high pop = above 11379155

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |> 
  mutate(popcat = case_when(pop <= 2043237 ~ "low",
                            pop > 2043237 & pop <= 11379155 ~ "med",
                            TRUE ~ "high"))

```

:::

### `join()`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

Typically in a data science or data analysis project one would have to work with many sources of data. The researcher must be able to combine multiple datasets to answer the questions he or she is interested in. Collectively, these multiple tables of data area called **relational data** because more than the individual datasets, its the relations that are more important.

As with the other `dplyr` verbs, there are different families of verbs that are designed to work with relational data and one of the most commonly used family of verbs are the mutating joins.

![Different type of joins, represented by a series of Venn Diagram](images/dplyr_joins.jpg){fig-align="center" width="300"}

These include:

-   `left_join(x, y)` which combines all columns in data frame `x` with those in data frame `y` but only retains rows from `x`.

-   `right_join(x, y)` also keeps all columns but operates in the opposite direction, returning only rows from `y`.

-   `full_join(x, y)` combines all columns of `x` with all columns of `y` and retains all rows from both data frames.

-   `inner_join(x, y)` combines all columns present in either `x` or `y` but only retains rows that are present in both data frames.

-   `anti_join(x, y)` returns the columns from `x` only and retains rows of `x` that are not present in `y`.

-   `anti_join(y, x)` returns the columns from `y` only and retains rows of `y` that are not present in `x`.

![Visual representation of the join() family of verbs](images/dplyr_joins1.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

Apart from specifying the data frames to be joined, we also need to specify the key column(s) that is to be used for joining the data. Key columns are specified with the `by` argument, e.g. `inner_join(x, y, by = "subject_id")` adds columns of `y` to `x` for all rows where the values of the "`subject_id`" column (present in each data frame) match. If the name of the key column is different in both the dataframes, e.g. "`subject_id`" in `x` and "`subj_id`" in `y`, then you have to specify both names using `by = c("subject_id" = "subj_id")`.

:::

### `pivot()`

:::{style="text-align:justify"}

Most often, when working with our data we may have to reshape our data from long format to wide format and back. We can use the `pivot` family of functions to achieve this task. What we mean by "the shape of our data" is how the values are distributed across rows or columns. Here's a visual representation of the same data in two different shapes:

![Long and Wide format of our data](images/long_wide.png){fig-align="center" width="394"}

-   "Long" format is where we have a column for each of the types of things we measured or recorded in our data. In other words, each variable has its own column.

-   "Wide" format occurs when we have data relating to the same measured thing in different columns. In this case, we have values related to our "metric" spread across multiple columns (a column each for a year).

Let us now use the `pivot` functions to reshape the data in practice. The two `pivot` functions are:

-   `pivot_wider()`: from long to wide format.
-   `pivot_longer()`: from wide to long format.

:::

{{< pagebreak >}}

# EXERCISE

1. In 2007, which 10 countries had the highest incidence_100k? (*Hint: filter() then arrange(), then head()*). Then `select()` only the country and the incidence_100k columns.

```{r}

tb |>

  filter(year == 2007) |>

  arrange(desc(incidence_100k)) |>

  head(10) |>

  select(country, incidence_100k)

```

2. Within the South East Asia who_region, which *countries* have incidence_100K > 300?

```{r}

tb |>

  filter(who_region == "SEA" & incidence_100k > 300) |>

  distinct(country)

```

3. How many countries are in each who_region? Put the output in order from lowest to highest number of countries _Hint: use `n_distinct()` inside `summarize()`_

```{r}

tb |>

  group_by(who_region) |>

  summarise(n_countries = n_distinct(country)) |>

  arrange(n_countries)

```

4. Recreate the `indian_subcont` variable you created above to see if the average incidence of tb per 100k differs between indian_subcont countries and other countries in the AMR who_region.

```{r}

tb |>

  mutate(indian_subcont = case_when(country %in% indian_subcont ~ "indian_subcont",

                          TRUE ~ "not")) |>

  group_by(indian_subcont) |>

  summarize(mTB = mean(incidence_100k + 1))

```

5. Excluding missing values on `hiv_incidence_100k`, what is the correlation coefficient (hint: `cor()`) for the relationship between the tb `incidence_100k` and the `hiv_incidence_100k` for each region. Show the output with the highest correlations first

```{r}

tb |>

  drop_na(hiv_incidence_100k) |>

  group_by(who_region) |>

  summarise(r = cor(incidence_100k, hiv_incidence_100k)) |>

  arrange(-r)

```

## `skimr` Package

`skimr` is designed to provide summary statistics about variables in data frames, tibbles, data tables and vectors. The core function of `skimr` is the `skim()` function, which is designed to work with (grouped) data frames, and will try coerce other objects to data frames if possible.

![](images/skimr.png){fig-align="center" width="100"}

Give `skim()` a try.

```{r}
#| eval: false

tb |> skimr::skim()
```

Check out the names of the output of `skimr`

```{r}
#| eval: false


tb |> skimr::skim() |> names()
```

Also works with `dplyr` verbs

```{r}
#| eval: false


tb |> group_by(who_region) |> skimr::skim()
```

```{r}
#| eval: false


tb |> skimr::skim() |> 
  dplyr::select(skim_type, skim_variable, n_missing)

```

## `DataExplorer` Package

The `DataExplorer` package aims to automate most of data handling and visualization, so that users could focus on studying the data and extracting insights.[^exploring_data-1]

[^exploring_data-1]: [DataExplorer Package](https://boxuancui.github.io/DataExplorer/)

![](images/dataexplorer.png){fig-align="center" width="100"}

The single most important function from the `DataExplorer` package is `create_report()`

Try it for yourself.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(DataExplorer)
create_report(tb)
```
