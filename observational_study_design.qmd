## Observational Study Design

An observational study is a type of research design where researchers observe and analyze subjects without manipulating any variables. This approach allows for the examination of real-world conditions and associations between exposures (such as risk factors or interventions) and outcomes (like diseases or behaviors) in a natural setting.

### Types of Observational Study Design

Broadly observational study designs are categorised as two:

-   Descriptive Study Designs
-   Analytical Study Designs

### Differentiate Descriptive & Analytical study design

The above links will take you to each of the study design and its characteristics, while to have a quick differentiation of the two, here is a table summarising the key points.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
df <- data.frame("Descriptive Study" = c("Describes phenomena as they exist", "Describes occurrence of outcome", "Deals with 'who', 'what','when', 'where'","Generates hypothesis", "No comparison group"),
"Analytical Study" = c("Understands phenomena", "Measures association between exposure & outcome", "Deals with 'why' and 'how'","Tests hypothesis","Presence of comparison group"))

kable(df, caption = "To Differentiate Descriptive & Analytical Study Design")
```

### Classification of Desciptive & Analytical study design

Each of the above mentioned study designs are further sub-classified as shown in the figure below:
