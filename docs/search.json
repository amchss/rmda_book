    "text": "2.1 Few Fundamental Concepts and their Importance in Research\nResearch, as we stated earlier, is discovering and validating innovative approaches to investigate and comprehend reality. By investigating reality, we mean to understand its nature and to gather knowledge about the reality and make sense about the same. This understanding of research takes us to the philosophical concepts of ontology, epistemology and axiology.\n\n2.1.1 Ontology\nOntology is the study of being and existence. It concerns the nature and structure of reality and what entities exist in the world.\n\nIt was called first philosophy by Aristotle.\nOrigin comes from the Latin term ontologia, science of being.\n\nIn the context of research, ontology influences how researchers conceptualize the nature of the reality they study. For instance, a researcher may adopt an objectivist ontology, believing that a reality exists independent of human perceptions, or a subjectivist/constructivist/constructionist ontology, where reality is seen as socially constructed.\nBroadly ontology may be divided into two, which is discussed below.\n\n\n2.1.2 Objectivist Ontology"

It examines the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge.\nIn research, epistemological considerations affect the researcher’s approach to acquiring knowledge. For example, a positivist epistemology emphasizes objective measurements and observable phenomena, while an interpretivist epistemology focuses on subjective experiences and understanding human behavior."

In this context, using the NHANES dataset, we can investigate whether the mean blood pressure (BP) of a sample of adults differs significantly from the standard “normal” BP value. For adults, normal BP is often considered to be around 120 mmHg for systolic pressure.\nHere’s how we can set up and conduct this test:\nHypotheses:\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): The mean systolic blood pressure of the sample is equal to the normal value (120 mmHg).\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): The mean systolic blood pressure of the sample differs from 120 mmHg.\nR Implementation: We’ll use the t.test() function to conduct the one-sample t-test, specifying 120 as the value for comparison.\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse)\n\n# Load NHANES data\n\n\ndf <- NHANES::NHANES\n\ndf <- df |> \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\ndf <- df |> \n  mutate(bp_sys_post = case_when(\n    bmi > 25 ~ round(bp_sys_ave + runif(n(), -8, -1), 0),  # Generate a new random number for each row\n    TRUE ~ round(bp_sys_ave + runif(n(), -2, 2), 0)        # Same for those with bmi <= 25\n  ))\n\n\n\n# Filter to include only adults\ndf <- df |> \n  filter(age >= 18)\n\n# Conduct a one-sample t-test\nt_test_result <- t.test(df$bp_sys_ave, mu = 120, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# View the result\nt_test_result\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  df$bp_sys_ave\nt = 3.6188, df = 7204, p-value = 0.0002981\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 120\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 120.3334 121.1215\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 120.7274 \n\n\nInterpretation of Results:\n\nt-Statistic: 3.618\nDegrees of Freedom: 7,204\np-value: 0.0002981\n95% Confidence Interval for Mean BP: (120.33, 121.12)\nSample Mean: 120.73 mmHg\n\nWith a p-value of 0.0003 (below 0.05), we conclude that the sample’s average blood pressure of 120.73 mmHg is statistically different from the normal BP value of 120 mmHg. However, for clinicians, it’s essential to think about what this small difference actually means for patient care.\nIn this case, while there’s a statistically significant difference, the 0.73 mmHg increase from the standard value is likely too small to have clinical importance. This reminds us that even if a result is statistically significant, it’s the practical impact on patient outcomes that ultimately matters."

The paired t-test is ideal for dependent samples, where each individual has measurements in both conditions (pre and post), allowing us to assess whether the intervention significantly impacted BP.\nFor the paired t-test examining blood pressure changes before and after an intervention among individuals with a BMI over 25, the hypotheses can be outlined as follows:\nHypotheses:\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): The mean systolic blood pressure before the intervention is equal to the mean blood pressure after the intervention for individuals with a BMI greater than 25. This implies that the intervention had no effect on blood pressure.\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): The mean systolic blood pressure before the intervention is different from the mean blood pressure after the intervention for individuals with a BMI greater than 25, suggesting a potential effect of the intervention on blood pressure.\nIf the test results in a p-value less than our significance threshold (typically 0.05), we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in blood pressure, likely attributable to the intervention.\n\n# Filter the dataset for individuals with BMI > 25\ndf_filtered <- df %>%\n  filter(bmi > 25)\n\n# Run a paired t-test\nt_test_result <- t.test(\n  df_filtered$bp_sys_post,\n  df_filtered$bp_sys_ave,\n  paired = TRUE)\n\n# Display the result\nt_test_result\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  df_filtered$bp_sys_post and df_filtered$bp_sys_ave\nt = -149.87, df = 4855, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -4.546345 -4.428943\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      -4.487644 \n\n\nPaired t-Test Results Interpretation\n\nT-Statistic:\n\nThe t-statistic is -155.16, indicating a significant difference in systolic blood pressure (BP) between the average pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements.\n\nDegrees of Freedom (df):\n\nThe degrees of freedom is 4855, indicating a large sample size, which adds robustness to the statistical findings.\n= P-Value:\nThe p-value is < 2.2e-16, which is extremely low and suggests a statistically significant difference in systolic blood pressure before and after the intervention. Since this p-value is well below the standard threshold of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a meaningful change in BP levels. Alternative Hypothesis:\nThe alternative hypothesis states that the true mean difference in systolic blood pressure between the two measurements (pre- and post-intervention) is not equal to zero.\n\n95% Confidence Interval:\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is (-4.603987, -4.489094). This interval indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true mean decrease in systolic blood pressure lies between -4.60 mmHg and -4.49 mmHg. Since the entire interval is negative, this strongly supports the conclusion that the intervention has led to a significant reduction in systolic BP.\n\nMean Difference:\n\nThe average difference in systolic blood pressure is approximately -4.55 mmHg, suggesting that, on average, individuals with a BMI greater than 25 experienced a decrease of 4.55 mmHg in systolic BP following the intervention.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe results of the paired t-test indicate that the intervention was effective, resulting in a statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure among individuals with a BMI greater than 25. The average decrease of 4.55 mmHg is both statistically significant and clinically relevant. This finding underscores the importance of the intervention in managing blood pressure among this population, suggesting that similar strategies may be beneficial for further lowering systolic blood pressure and improving cardiovascular health."

    "text": "17.4 Chi-Squared Test\nThe chi-squared test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. By comparing the observed frequency distribution of categories with the expected distribution (assuming no association), the test evaluates whether the variables are independent of each other or if there is an association. This test is particularly useful in analyzing relationships in large datasets with categorical data, like survey responses or patient characteristics.\nAs an example, we’ll use the chi-squared test to examine whether there is an association between BMI category and diabetes status among adults in our dataset.\nHypotheses:\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): There is no association between BMI category and diabetes status (BMI and diabetes status are independent).\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): There is an association between BMI category and diabetes status.\nData Preparation\nEnsure that the bmi_who and diabetes variables are factors:\nIf not then make it factor variable.\n\nclass(df$bmi_who)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\nclass(df$diabetes)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n\nBoth variables are factor.\nCreating a Contingency Table in Tidy Format\nTo perform a chi-squared test, we first need a contingency table that shows the counts of individuals in each combination of bmi_who and diabetes categories.\n\n# Create contingency table in tidy format\ncontingency_table <- table(df$bmi_who, df$diabetes)\n\nPerforming the Chi-Squared Test\nTo assess whether an association exists between BMI category and diabetes, we apply the chi-squared test as follows:\n\n# Conduct the chi-squared test\nchi_test <- chisq.test(contingency_table)\n\n# View the test results\nchi_test\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  contingency_table\nX-squared = 206.12, df = 3, p-value < 2.2e-16\n\n\nInterpretation of Chi-Squared Test Results\n\nChi-Squared Statistic (X-squared): 206.12\nDegrees of Freedom (df): 3\np-value: < 2.2e-16\n\nSince the p-value is extremely small (less than 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a statistically significant association between BMI category and diabetes status. This suggests that diabetes prevalence differs across BMI categories in our sample.\nHowever, while statistical significance tells us there is an association, it does not reveal the direction or strength of the relationship. To determine the strength and direction—such as whether higher BMI categories are positively associated with increased diabetes risk—you could perform a regression analysis.\nFor binary outcomes like diabetes status, logistic regression would be a suitable approach. It would allow us to model the probability of diabetes as a function of BMI categories while providing insights into how each category impacts the likelihood of diabetes, as reflected by odds ratios. This approach also enables adjustments for potential confounders, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship."

A larger Sum of Squares for the BMI groups relative to the residuals suggests substantial variation in systolic blood pressure due to BMI category.\nMean Squares (Mean Sq): This is the Sum of Squares divided by the respective degrees of freedom. The larger Mean Square for BMI groups indicates a larger variability attributed to BMI categories compared to random error.\nF-value: The F-value of 50.35 is substantial, suggesting that the variation in systolic blood pressure between the BMI categories is much greater than within each category.\np-value (< 2e-16): The extremely small p-value is well below 0.05, leading us to reject the null hypothesis.

    "text": "1.2 Defining Research\nResearch may be defined as the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing knowledge in a new and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies and understandings. This could include synthesis and analysis of previous research to the extent that it leads to new and creative outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch is the cornerstone of human advancement, serving as a systematic inquiry that seeks to uncover new information, validate existing knowledge, and solve complex problems. Unlike other species, humans possess the unique ability to document and share their findings, creating a continuous thread of knowledge that connects past discoveries to present inquiries. This cumulative nature of knowledge is essential; each generation builds upon the insights of those who came before, allowing for profound advancements in science, technology, the arts, and social understanding.\nLet us visit few definitions given for research by luminaries in the field.\n\nResearch is an endeavor to discover, develop and verify knowledge. It is an intellectual process that has developed over hundreds of years, ever changing in purpose and form and always searching for truth.\n- C Francis Rummel\nResearch is a point of a view, an attitude of inquiry or a frame of mind.It asks questions which have till now not been asked, and it seeks to answer them by following a fairly definite procedure. It is not a mere theorizing, but rather an attempt to elicit facts and to face them once they have been assembled. Research is likewise not an attempt to bolster up pre-conceived opinions, and implies a readiness to accept the conclusions to which an inquiry leads, no matter how unwelcome they may prove. When successful, research adds to the scientific knowledge of the subject.\n- Robert Robertson Rusk\nBoth Rummel and Rusk emphasize the dynamic and inquisitive nature of research, though they approach it from slightly different angles. Rummel highlights the historical evolution of research as a continuous quest for truth, framing it as a rigorous intellectual process aimed at discovering and verifying knowledge. In contrast, Rusk focuses on the mindset and procedural rigor involved in research. He emphasizes the importance of questioning established norms and being open to unexpected findings. This definition stresses that research is not just about affirming existing beliefs but about genuinely seeking new knowledge through systematic inquiry.\nTo be sure the best research is that which is reliable, verifiable, and exhaustive, so that it provides information in which we have confidence. The main point here is that research is, literally speaking, a kind of human behaviour, an activity in which people engage.\n- Francis G Cornell\n\nCornell, here adds another dimension by asserting that effective research must be reliable, verifiable, and exhaustive. This perspective emphasizes the credibility of research findings and their importance in fostering confidence. By characterizing research as a form of human behavior, Fourier highlights its collaborative and social aspects, recognizing that research involves interaction and engagement among individuals."
