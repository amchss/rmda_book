    "text": "Simple Linear regression (SLR) is one of the most widely used statistical methods for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable. However, to ensure the model’s accuracy and validity, several assumptions must be met.\n\n\n18.1.1 Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression\n\nThe acronym LINE helps us remember the key assumptions needed for making inferences and predictions with models based on linear least squares regression (LLSR).\nIn the case of simple linear regression with a single predictor \\(X\\), the assumptions are as follows:\n\nL (Linear relationship): The mean of the response variable \\(Y\\) is linearly related to the predictor variable \\(X\\).\nI (Independence of errors): The errors (or residuals) are independent, meaning that the distance between any two points from the regression line is unrelated.\nN (Normal distribution): For each value of \\(X\\), the response \\(Y\\) is normally distributed.\nE (Equal variance): The variance (or standard deviation) of the responses is constant for all values of \\(X\\).\n\nThese assumptions can be illustrated visually:\n\n\n\nAssumptions for linear least squares regression (LLSR) (Roback and Legler, 2021)\n\n\n\nL: The expected value of \\(Y\\) at each \\(X\\) lies along the regression line.\nI: We should verify that the design of the study ensures the errors are independent.\nN: The values of \\(Y\\) are normally distributed at each level of \\(X\\).\nE: The spread of \\(Y\\) is consistent across all levels of \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n\n18.1.2 The Simple Linear Regression Model\n\nIn SLR, the goal is to model the relationship between a dependent variable (response) and an independent variable (predictor). The model predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variable, helping us understand how changes in one variable impact the other.\nThe general form of a simple linear regression model is:\n\\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(Y\\) is the dependent variable (the outcome we are predicting).\n\\(X\\) is the independent variable (the predictor).\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept (the expected value of \\(Y\\) when \\(X=0\\)).\n\\(\\beta_1\\) is the slope (the change in \\(Y\\) for each unit increase in \\(X\\)).\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term, representing the variability in \\(Y\\) not explained by \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n\n18.1.3 Interpreting the Model\n\n\nIntercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)): The intercept tells us the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. However, in some cases, like the relationship between height and weight, interpreting the intercept might not make practical sense (e.g., predicting weight when height is zero).\nSlope (\\(\\beta_1\\)): The slope indicates the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. For example, if we are looking at the relationship between height and weight, the slope tells us how much weight is expected to increase (or decrease) for every unit increase in height.\nError term (\\(\\epsilon\\)): The error term captures the variation in the dependent variable that is not explained by the independent variable. In practice, our model won’t perfectly predict every observation, and this error term accounts for the difference between observed values and the values predicted by the model.",

    "text": "18.2 Simple Linear Regression Using R\n\nIf the assumptions of simple linear regression are met, we can proceed with fitting the model to the data. In this section, we will explore how to perform simple linear regression using R. This method allows us to examine the relationship between a dependent variable (response) and an independent variable (predictor) and make predictions based on the data.\n\n\n18.2.1 Simple Linear Regression with a Numeric Independent Variable\n\nWhen dealing with a numeric independent variable, simple linear regression helps us understand how changes in the independent variable affect the dependent variable. In R, we can easily fit and evaluate this relationship using the lm() function.\nHere’s an example of performing simple linear regression when the independent variable is numeric:\nResearch Question\nUsing the NHANES dataset, our research question is:\nIn adults, is there a relationship between height (independent variable) and weight (dependent variable)?\n\nData Wrangling\n\nBefore we perform the Simple Linear Regression, we need to load and clean the NHANES dataset.\n\n\n# Instal and load packages\n\n#install.packages(pacman)\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, broom)\n\n\n# Load Data\n\ndf &lt;- NHANES::NHANES\n\ndf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(Age &gt;= 18)\n\n# Set \"White\" as the reference category directly using factor()\ndf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  mutate(Race1 = factor(Race1, levels = c(\"White\", \"Black\", \"Mexican\", \"Hispanic\", \"Other\")))\n\n\n\n# Clean names\n\ndf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\ndf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  rename(race = race1)\n\nSLR Model\n\nNow, we build the linear regression model to examine the relationship between height and weight in adults.\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(weight ~ height, data = df)\n\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ height, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-41.329 -13.299  -2.887   9.673 149.022 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Below is a breakdown of the model output:\nModel Equation\nThe general form is\n\\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X\\]\nThe model equation based on the output can be written as:\n\\[\\text{Weight} = -78.07 + 0.95 \\times \\text{Height}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\hat{y}\\) is the predicted weight (in kg)\nThe intercept (-78.07) represents the predicted weight when height is zero, which doesn’t have a practical interpretation in this context but is mathematically part of the model.\nThe slope (0.95) indicates that for each additional unit of height (in cm), the weight is expected to increase by approximately 0.95 kg, on average.\n\nCoefficients\n\nIntercept (-78.07): The negative intercept is not practically meaningful since height cannot be zero in adults, but it is part of the linear equation.\nHeight (0.95): The slope suggests that for every additional centimeter in height, weight increases by about 0.95 kg on average. The very small p-value (\\(&lt;2e^-16\\)) indicates that the effect of height on weight is highly statistically significant.\n\nResiduals\nThe residuals show the differences between the observed and predicted values of weight:\n\nThe minimum residual is -41.33, and the maximum is 149.02, indicating some large deviations.\nThe median residual is -2.89, suggesting that most predictions are close to the observed values.\n\nGoodness of Fit\nR-squared (0.2025) Approximately 20.25% of the variance in weight is explained by height, which suggests that while height has a significant impact on weight, other factors also influence weight substantially.\nAdjusted R-squared (0.2024) Very close to the R-squared, confirming the model is reliable for this data.\nModel Significance\nThe F-statistic (1882) and its corresponding p-value (&lt;2.2e−16) indicate that the model is highly significant, meaning height is a useful predictor for weight in this dataset.\nThe interpretation shows that height has a positive and significant relationship with weight, but the relatively low \\(R^2\\) value suggests that other factors besides height influence weight.\n\n\n\n18.2.2 Simple Linear Regression with a Categorical Independent Variable\nWhen dealing with a categorical independent variable, simple linear regression can be used to analyze how the different categories influence the dependent variable. In this case, we’ll explore the relationship between height and race in adults using the NHANES dataset.\nResearch Question\nIs there an association between race and weight in adult individuals from the NHANES dataset?\nSLR Model\nIn this analysis, we treat race as a categorical variable and examine its relationship with weight The regression equation for a categorical independent variable will include dummy coding (where one category is taken as the reference).\nHere’s how you can perform the simple linear regression with a categorical variable in R:\n\n# SLR Model with Categorical Independent Variable\nmodel_cat &lt;- lm(weight ~ race, data = df)\n\nsummary(model_cat)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ race, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-48.787 -15.028  -2.828  11.872 142.813 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

They range from a minimum of -48.79 to a maximum of 142.81, showing variability in model predictions.\nGoodness of Fit\n\nResidual standard error: 21.02, indicating the average distance between observed and predicted values.\nMultiple R-squared: 0.02501, meaning that approximately 2.5% of the variability in weight is explained by race.\nAdjusted R-squared: 0.02448, which adjusts for the number of predictors in the model.",

For numeric variables, you can explore measures of central tendency like the mean, median, and mode. These give you a glimpse into the typical values of your dataset. But that’s not all—measures of dispersion, such as standard deviation, variance, and range, tell you how spread out your data is.\nAnd don’t forget about categorical variables!

    "text": "15.2 Numerical Methods for a Single Variable using R\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, there are various ways to describe variables based on their types. In this section, we’ll explore how to describe different variables using R. First, we’ll look at numerical variables (both discrete and continuous), and then we’ll dive into categorical variables (nominal and ordinal).\n\n\n15.2.1 Describing a Single Numerical (Discrete / Categorical) Variable using R\n\nNow, let’s explore how to describe numerical variables. We can use various measures, including mean, median, range, standard deviation, interquartile range, and percentiles.\n\n\n15.2.1.1 Mean\n\nThe mean is the average of all the data points.\n\n# Calculate the mean\ndf |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  mean_age\n     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     36.7\n\n\nAnother Way\n\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  mean()\n\n[1] 36.7421\n\n\nWhat does df |&gt; pull(age) means. Try yourself!\nNow lets find the mean height.\n\ndf |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_height = mean(height))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  mean_height\n        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          NA\n\n\nWhy does the mean height show NA?\nWhen you try calculating the mean of the height variable, you might notice that it returns NA. This happens because some individual observations for height have missing values (NA).\nTo solve this, we need to tell R to ignore those missing values when performing the calculation. For this, we use an additional argument in the mean() function: na.rm = TRUE. This argument stands for “remove NAs,” and when set to TRUE, it ensures the missing values are ignored, allowing R to calculate the mean based on the available data.\n\n# Calculate the mean while having NA values\n\ndf |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_height = mean(height), na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  mean_height na.rm\n        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;\n1          NA TRUE \n\n\nBy adding this small argument, you’ll get the correct mean without being tripped up by missing data!\n\n\n\n\n15.2.1.2 Median\n\nThe median is the middle value when the data is ordered.\n\n# Calculate the median\ndf |&gt; \n  summarise(median_age = median(age))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  median_age\n       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         36\n\ndf |&gt; \n  summarise(median_height = median(height, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  median_height\n          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1           166\n\n\nTry finding median using pull function from the dplyr package.\n\n\n\n\n15.2.1.3 Range\n\nThe range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n\n# Calculate the range\n\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  range()\n\n[1]  0 80\n\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(height) |&gt; \n  range(na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1]  83.6 200.4\n\n\nIf you want to find the maximum and minimum values separately, you can do this:\n\n# Calculate the Maximum\n\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  max()\n\n[1] 80\n\n# Calculate the Minimum\n\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  min()\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.1.4 Standard Deviation\n\nStandard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a variable.\n\n# Calculate the standard deviation\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  sd()\n\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(height) |&gt; \n  sd(na.rm = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.1.5 Percentiles\n\nPercentiles indicate the relative standing of a value within the dataset.\n\n# Calculate specific percentiles (e.g., 25th and 75th percentiles)\n\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  quantile(probs = 0.25)\n\n25% \n 17 \n\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  quantile(probs = 0.75)\n\n75% \n 54 \n\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  quantile(probs = c(0.25, 0.75))\n\n25% 75% \n 17  54 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.1.6 Inter Quartile Range\n\nThe IQR is the range between the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3).\n\n# Calculate the IQR\ndf |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  IQR()\n\n[1] 37\n\n\nThere’s another way to approach this. We can estimate the third quartile, which represents the 75th percentile, and the first quartile, which corresponds to the 25th percentile. By calculating the difference between these two values, we arrive at the interquartile range (IQR).\n\n# Calculate the IQR\n\nq_1 &lt;- df |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  quantile(probs = 0.25)\n\n\nq_3 &lt;- df |&gt; \n  pull(age) |&gt; \n  quantile(probs = 0.75)\n\n\nq_3 - q_1\n\n75% \n 37 \n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.1.7 Combining Multiple Summary Measures\n\nIf you want to combine multiple measures as a single outcome, it is also possible.\n\ndf |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    min_age = min(age),\n    q1_age = quantile(age, prob = 0.25), \n    mean_age = mean(age),\n    median_age = median(age), \n    q3_age = quantile(age, prob = 0.75),\n    max_age = max(age)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  min_age q1_age mean_age median_age q3_age max_age\n    &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1       0     17     36.7         36     54      80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.2 Describing a Single Categorical (Nominal / Ordinal) Variable using R\n\nNow let’s dive into categorical variables! When working with categorical data, we often summarize it using frequencies (how often each category appears), percentages (what proportion of the total each category makes up), and cumulative percentages (the running total of those percentages). Let’s explore how to do all of this in a tidy way using R.\nWe’ll continue working with the NHANES dataset to see this in action.\n\n\n\n15.2.2.1 Frequency\n\nFrequency tells us how many times each category appears in the data. Let’s calculate the frequency for the income variable (hh_income).\n\n# Calculate the frequency of each category in 'hh_income'\n\nhh_income_frequency &lt;- df |&gt; \n  count(hh_income)\n\nhh_income_frequency\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 2\n   hh_income         n\n   &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1 \" 0-4999\"       192\n 2 \" 5000-9999\"    254\n 3 \"10000-14999\"   543\n 4 \"15000-19999\"   527\n 5 \"20000-24999\"   617\n 6 \"25000-34999\"   958\n 7 \"35000-44999\"   863\n 8 \"45000-54999\"   784\n 9 \"55000-64999\"   621\n10 \"65000-74999\"   526\n11 \"75000-99999\"  1084\n12 \"more 99999\"   2220\n13  &lt;NA&gt;           811\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.2.2 Percent\n\nNext, we’ll calculate the percentage for each category, which shows the relative proportion of each category within the dataset.\n\n# Calculate the percentage for each category in 'hh_income'\n\nhh_income_percent &lt;- df  |&gt; \n  count(hh_income) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100)\n\nhh_income_percent\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 3\n   hh_income         n percent\n   &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 \" 0-4999\"       192    1.92\n 2 \" 5000-9999\"    254    2.54\n 3 \"10000-14999\"   543    5.43\n 4 \"15000-19999\"   527    5.27\n 5 \"20000-24999\"   617    6.17\n 6 \"25000-34999\"   958    9.58\n 7 \"35000-44999\"   863    8.63\n 8 \"45000-54999\"   784    7.84\n 9 \"55000-64999\"   621    6.21\n10 \"65000-74999\"   526    5.26\n11 \"75000-99999\"  1084   10.8 \n12 \"more 99999\"   2220   22.2 \n13  &lt;NA&gt;           811    8.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.2.3 Cumulative Percent\n\nCumulative percent shows the running total of percentages, which can help understand the distribution across categories as you move through them.\n\n# Calculate cumulative percentage for 'hh_income'\n\nhh_income_cumulative &lt;- df |&gt; \n  count(hh_income) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent = n / sum(n) * 100,\n         cumulative_percent = cumsum(percent))\n\nhh_income_cumulative\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 4\n   hh_income         n percent cumulative_percent\n   &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 \" 0-4999\"       192    1.92               1.92\n 2 \" 5000-9999\"    254    2.54               4.46\n 3 \"10000-14999\"   543    5.43               9.89\n 4 \"15000-19999\"   527    5.27              15.2 \n 5 \"20000-24999\"   617    6.17              21.3 \n 6 \"25000-34999\"   958    9.58              30.9 \n 7 \"35000-44999\"   863    8.63              39.5 \n 8 \"45000-54999\"   784    7.84              47.4 \n 9 \"55000-64999\"   621    6.21              53.6 \n10 \"65000-74999\"   526    5.26              58.8 \n11 \"75000-99999\"  1084   10.8               69.7 \n12 \"more 99999\"   2220   22.2               91.9 \n13  &lt;NA&gt;           811    8.11             100   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.3 Publication Ready Tables\n\nTo create publication-ready tables, you can use the gtsummary package in R.

    "text": "15.3 Numerical Methods for Two Variables using R\n\nIn this section, we’ll dive into how to describe relationships between two variables using R. Depending on the types of variables—categorical or numeric—the methods vary. We’ll cover three main scenarios:\n\nTwo categorical variables\nTwo numeric variables\nOne categorical and one numeric variable\n\n\n\n15.3.1 Two Categorical Variables\n\nWhen working with two categorical variables, one of the most common ways to analyze the relationship between them is by using cross-tabulation.\nCross-tabulation creates a contingency table that shows the frequency distribution for each combination of categories.\nLet’s use the gender and race1 variables in the NHANES dataset to explore this.\n\n\n15.3.1.1 Cross-Tabulation\n\n# Cross-tabulation of 'gender' and 'race1'\ngender_race_table &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  count(gender, race1)\n\ngender_race_table\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   gender race1        n\n   &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 female Black      614\n 2 female Hispanic   320\n 3 female Mexican    452\n 4 female White     3221\n 5 female Other      413\n 6 male   Black      583\n 7 male   Hispanic   290\n 8 male   Mexican    563\n 9 male   White     3151\n10 male   Other      393\n\n\n\nThis table shows how the categories of gender and race1 are distributed across each other. But to make this even more informative, let’s add percentages.\n\n\n\n15.3.1.2 Cross-Tabulation with Percentages\n\n# Cross-tabulation with percentages\ngender_race_percent &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  count(gender, race1) %&gt;%\n  group_by(gender) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent = n / sum(n) * 100)\n\ngender_race_percent\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n# Groups:   gender [2]\n   gender race1        n percent\n   &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 female Black      614   12.2 \n 2 female Hispanic   320    6.37\n 3 female Mexican    452    9.00\n 4 female White     3221   64.2 \n 5 female Other      413    8.23\n 6 male   Black      583   11.7 \n 7 male   Hispanic   290    5.82\n 8 male   Mexican    563   11.3 \n 9 male   White     3151   63.3 \n10 male   Other      393    7.89\n\n\n\nThis output gives us a clearer picture of the relationship between the two categorical variables by showing the percentage of each race within each gender group.\n\n\n\n\n15.3.2 Two Numeric Variables\n\nWhen both variables are numeric, we can correlation to explore the relationship between them.\n\n\n15.3.2.1 Correlation\n\nCorrelation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two numeric variables. The most common measure is Pearson’s correlation coefficient.\nLet’s calculate the correlation between height and weight.\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  drop_na(height, weight) |&gt; \n  summarise(correlation = cor(height, weight))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  correlation\n        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       0.749\n\n\nAnother Way\n\n# Correlation between height and weight\ndf %&gt;%\n  summarise(correlation = cor(height, weight, use = \"complete.obs\"))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  correlation\n        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       0.749\n\n\nHere, use = \"complete.obs\" ensures that rows with missing values (NA) are ignored during the correlation calculation, just like na.rm = TRUE would do.\n\n\n\n\n15.3.3 One categorical and One Numeric Variables\n\nWhen you have one categorical and one numeric variable, you’re often interested in comparing the distribution of the numeric variable across different categories. Group-wise summaries and box plots are common methods for this.\nLet’s look at the relationship between gender (categorical) and height (numeric).\nGroup-Wise Summaries We can calculate summary statistics (like mean and median) for height within each gender category.\n\n\n# Group-wise summary of height by gender\ndf %&gt;%\n  group_by(gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE),\n    median_height = median(height, na.rm = TRUE),\n    sd_height = sd(height, na.rm = TRUE),\n    iqr_height = IQR(height, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  gender mean_height median_height sd_height iqr_height\n  &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 female        157.          161.      16.8       11.6\n2 male          167.          174.      21.9       13.2\n\n\n\n\n15.3.4 Publication Ready Tables for Two Variables\n\nWhen you need to present results in a polished, publication-ready format, the gtsummary package in R is an excellent tool. It allows you to easily create clean, professional tables summarizing relationships between two variables. Below is an example of how you can use gtsummary to generate a table for a two-variable analysis, showcasing how your results can be made ready for publication.\n\n# Create a publication-ready table for two categorical variables\ntable_cat &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  select(gender, race1) %&gt;%\n  tbl_summary(by = gender, \n              label = race1 ~ \"Race/Ethnicity\") \n\n# Display the table\ntable_cat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nfemale\nN = 5,0201\nmale\nN = 4,9801\n\n\n\n\nRace/Ethnicity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Black\n614 (12%)\n583 (12%)\n\n\n    Hispanic\n320 (6.4%)\n290 (5.8%)\n\n\n    Mexican\n452 (9.0%)\n563 (11%)\n\n\n    White\n3,221 (64%)\n3,151 (63%)\n\n\n    Other\n413 (8.2%)\n393 (7.9%)\n\n\n\n1 n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re comparing a numeric variable across categories (e.g., height by gender), use the tbl_summary() function with the by argument.\n\n# Create a publication-ready table for a categorical and a numeric variables\n\ntable_cat_num &lt;- df  |&gt; \n  select(gender, height) |&gt; \n  drop_na() |&gt; \n  tbl_summary(by = gender, \n              label = height ~ \"Height\") \n\n# Display the table\ntable_cat_num\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nfemale\nN = 4,8471\nmale\nN = 4,8001\n\n\n\n\nHeight\n161 (154, 166)\n174 (166, 179)\n\n\n\n1 Median (Q1, Q3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need mean and standard deviation instead of median and IQR, then\n\ntable_cat_num &lt;- df  |&gt; \n  select(gender, height) |&gt; \n  drop_na() |&gt; \n  tbl_summary(\n    by = gender,\n    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ \"{mean} ({sd})\")\n  ) \n\n# Display the table\ntable_cat_num\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nfemale\nN = 4,8471\nmale\nN = 4,8001\n\n\n\n\nheight\n157 (17)\n167 (22)\n\n\n\n1 Mean (SD)",

    "text": "14.3 Data Visualization Using R: Introduction to Grammar of Graphics\n\nData visualization in R can be effectively done using the ggplot2 package, which is included in the popular tidyverse collection of R packages. ggplot2 is based on the Grammar of Graphics, a structured approach that allows you to build plots layer by layer. This grammar provides a framework for describing and creating visualizations by combining different graphical elements. The idea is that any plot can be constructed by breaking it down into components.\nThe visualisation using ggplot2 package, which follows the philosophy of grammar of graphics, breaks down a plot into several components:\n\nData: The dataset you’re working with.\nAesthetics: The visual properties (e.g., axes, colors, sizes).\nGeometries: The type of plot (e.g., points, bars, lines).\nFacets: Dividing the data into subplots.\nScales: Mapping of data values to visual properties.\nCoordinates: How data is projected onto the plane (e.g., Cartesian coordinates).\n\n\nWhat Happens When You Run ggplot()?\nWhen you run ggplot() in R without specifying any further components, it provides you with a blank “canvas” (or plane) on which you can build your plot. This is like opening a blank sheet of paper to start drawing. Here’s an example:\n\n# Load Packages\n#install.packages(pacman)\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, here)\n\n# Load Data\n\ndf1 &lt;- NHANES::NHANES\n\ndf1 &lt;- df1 |&gt; \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\ndf &lt;- df1 |&gt; \n  select(id, survey_yr, gender, age, race1, education, marital_status, hh_income, home_own, home_rooms, poverty, work, weight, height)\n\n\n# Running ggplot without specifying layers\nggplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will simply give you a blank plot. You then need to add layers to specify what the plot will contain.\n\n\n\nAesthetics (aes)\n\nAesthetic mappings define how data is mapped to visual properties. They include properties such as:\n\nx and y axes: Mapped to variables in your data.\ncolor: Used to differentiate categories.\nsize: Used to represent magnitude or importance.\n\nFor example, when you add aesthetics to ggplot(), it tells R how to map data to the plot:\n\nggplot(data = df, \n       mapping = aes(x = height, y = weight))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, height is mapped to the x-axis and weight to the y-axis\n\n\n\nLayers in ggplot2\n\nThe power of ggplot2 lies in its layering system. After creating the base plot with ggplot(), you can add multiple layers.\nYou add these layers using the + operator\nFor Example:\n\n# Adding layers to create a plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Height vs Weight\",\n       caption = \"Source: NHANES Data\") \n\nWarning: Removed 366 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a breakdown of each layer in the example:\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = height, y = weight)): This initializes the plot using the df dataset. Inside aes(), the x-axis is mapped to xvariable (height), and the y-axis is mapped to yvariable (weight). The aes() function defines aesthetic mappings, determining how data is represented visually.\ngeom_point(): This adds a geometric layer, specifically a scatter plot, where each point represents an observation. It visualizes the relationship between x and y\nlabs(title = \"Height vs Weight\", caption = \"Source: NHANES Data\"): This layer adds a title and a caption to the plot, making it more interpretable. The title helps to explain what the plot is displaying.\n\nEach layer builds on the previous one, progressively adding more information to the visualization.\nNote\nEvery geometric layer starts with geom_ in ggplot2.",

    "text": "14.4 Visualising a Single Variable using R\n\nGraphical methods are essential for summarizing and understanding the distribution of a single variable. In this section, we will explore different types of plots for visualizing one variable, based on its type (nominal, ordinal, discrete, or continuous). The key graphical methods include bar charts, boxplots, histograms, and density plots.\n\n\n14.4.1 Bar Chart\n\nA bar chart is used to represent categorical data (nominal or ordinal). Each bar represents the frequency (or count) of a category. It’s commonly used for visualizing nominal variables like gender or education level.\nExample:\n\n# Bar chart example for a nominal variable\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = gender)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Bar Chart of Gender\", \n    x = \"Gender\", \n    y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4.2 Boxplot\n\nA boxplot is used to represent the distribution of a continuous variable. It shows the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.\nExample:\n\n# Boxplot example for a continuous variable\nggplot(df, aes(y = height)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Height\")\n\nWarning: Removed 353 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4.3 Histogram\n\nA histogram is used to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing the data into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin. It’s useful for understanding the shape, spread, and central tendency of continuous variables like age or income.\nExample:\n\n# Histogram example for a continuous variable\nggplot(df, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Height\", x = \"Height\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

It provides an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable.\n\n# Density plot example for a continuous variable\nggplot(df, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_density(\n    alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Density Plot of Height\", \n    x = \"Height\") +\ntheme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 353 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can represent the area under the curve using any color.\n\n# Density plot example for a continuous variable\nggplot(df, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_density(\n    fill = \"green\", \n    alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Density Plot of Height\", \n    x = \"Height\") +\ntheme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 353 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4.5 Combining Multiple Geometries: Overlaying Histogram and Density Plot\n\nOne of the strengths of ggplot2 is its ability to add multiple geometric shapes (geoms) to a single plot. For example, you can overlay a density plot on top of a histogram to visualize both the frequency distribution and the smoothed probability distribution of a continuous variable in a single canvas.\nExample: Histogram and Density Plot Together\n\n# Combining histogram and density plot\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = height)) +\n  # Histogram with density scaling\n  geom_histogram(\n    aes(y = after_stat(density)),        # Normalize the histogram to show density instead of counts\n    binwidth = 2,                # Sets the bin width for the histogram\n    fill = \"blue\",               # Fills the bars with blue color\n    color = \"black\",             # Outlines the bars with black\n    alpha = 0.6                  # Adds transparency to the bars\n  ) +\n  # Density plot\n  geom_density(\n    aes(y = after_stat(density)),        # Ensures the y-axis of density is consistent\n    color = \"red\",               # The density plot will be red\n    linewidth = 1                     # Thickness of the density line\n  ) +\n  # Labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Histogram and Density Plot of Height\",  # Title for the plot\n    x = \"Height\",                                    # X-axis label\n    y = \"Density\"                                    # Y-axis label\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()                                     # Apply a clean theme\n\nWarning: Removed 353 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 353 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).",

    "section": "14.5 Visualising Two Variables using R",
    "text": "14.5 Visualising Two Variables using R\n\nWhen working with two variables, visualizing the relationship between them helps reveal patterns, associations, or differences. The appropriate plot depends on the types of variables involved (categorical, continuous, or a combination). In this section, we will explore different graphical methods for visualizing two variables: stacked bar charts, grouped bar charts, scatter plots, box plots by category, and regression lines with standard error.\n\n\n14.5.1 Stacked Bar Chart\n\nA stacked bar chart is used when both variables are categorical. It displays the distribution of one variable while stacking the bars based on the categories of the second variable.\nExample:\n\n# Stacked bar chart example for two categorical variables\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = gender, fill = race1)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"stack\") +\n  labs(title = \"Stacked Bar Chart of Gender by Race\", x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", fill = \"Race\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.2 Grouped Bar Chart\n\nA grouped bar chart is another option for visualizing two categorical variables. Instead of stacking the bars, it places bars for each category side-by-side, allowing for a clearer comparison between categories.\nExample:\n\n# Grouped bar chart example for two categorical variables\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = race1, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Grouped Bar Chart of Gender by Race\", x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", fill = \"Race\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.3 Scatter Plot\n\nA scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. Each point on the plot represents an observation, and patterns like clusters, trends, or outliers can be detected.\nExample:\n\n# Scatter plot example for two continuous variables\nggplot(df, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Height vs Weight\",\n       caption = \"Source: NHANES Data\")\n\nWarning: Removed 366 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.4 Box Plot by Category\n\nA box plot by category is useful when comparing the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories of a categorical variable. It shows the median, quartiles, and potential outliers within each category.\nExample:\n\n# Box plot example for a continuous variable by category\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = gender, y = height)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot of Height by Gender\", x = \"Gender\", y = \"Height\")\n\nWarning: Removed 353 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.5 Combining Multiple Geometries: Scatter Plot with Regression Line\n\nA scatter plot with a regression line helps visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. Adding a regression line shows the trend, while the standard error (SE) band around the line indicates the uncertainty in the estimate of the relationship.\nWhile regression is an inferential method (used for making predictions or understanding relationships), the purpose of this example is to demonstrate how multiple geometries can be combined when visualizing two variables.\nExample:\n\n# Scatter plot with regression line and SE\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = height, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6) +    # Add scatter plot points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",                   # Add a regression line\n              color = \"red\",                   # Set the color of the line\n              se = TRUE,                       # Add the SE band (uncertainty)\n              fill = \"lightgray\",              # Color of the SE band\n              size = 1) +                      # Set thickness of the line\n  labs(\n    title = \"Scatter Plot with Regression Line and SE Band\",  # Title\n    x = \"Height (cm)\",                                        # X-axis label\n    y = \"Weight (kg)\"                                         # Y-axis label\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()                                              # Apply a clean theme\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 366 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 366 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).",

Each stage, contributes to the validity of the findings and following established procedures reduces bias and increases the reliability of results.\nLet’s enlist the steps one by one.\nThe research journey begins with the identification of a specific problem or question. This step requires a clear definition of the issue at hand, ensuring that the research is focused and relevant. Engaging with existing literature can help refine the problem and clarify its significance.\nOnce the problem is identified, a comprehensive literature review is conducted. This step involves analyzing existing studies, theories, and frameworks related to the topic. The insights gained from this review not only provide context but also highlight gaps in current knowledge, informing the research design.\nBased on the literature review, researchers can formulate a hypothesis or a set of research questions. This step is crucial as it guides the direction of the study, framing what the researcher aims to discover or test. A well-defined hypothesis provides a clear focus for the research.\nThe next step involves designing the research methodology. This includes selecting appropriate research methods (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods), determining data collection techniques, and establishing a plan for analysis. A well-structured methodology is essential for obtaining valid and reliable results.\nWith the methodology in place, researchers proceed to collect data. This phase can involve surveys, experiments, interviews, or observational studies, depending on the research design. Effective data collection is critical, as it forms the foundation for analysis and interpretation.\nAfter data collection, the analysis phase begins. Researchers employ statistical tools, qualitative analysis methods, or other techniques to interpret the data. This step reveals patterns, relationships, and insights, providing answers to the research questions or validating the hypothesis.\nThe final step is reporting the research findings. This includes writing a detailed report or paper, presenting at conferences, or publishing in academic journals. Sharing results is crucial for advancing knowledge and sparking further inquiry in the field.",

This could include synthesis and analysis of previous research to the extent that it leads to new and creative outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch is the cornerstone of human advancement, serving as a systematic inquiry that seeks to uncover new information, validate existing knowledge, and solve complex problems. Unlike other species, humans possess the unique ability to document and share their findings, creating a continuous thread of knowledge that connects past discoveries to present inquiries. This cumulative nature of knowledge is essential; each generation builds upon the insights of those who came before, allowing for profound advancements in science, technology, the arts, and social understanding.\nLet us visit few definitions given for research by luminaries in the field.\n\nResearch is an endeavor to discover, develop and verify knowledge. It is an intellectual process that has developed over hundreds of years, ever changing in purpose and form and always searching for truth.\n- C Francis Rummel\nResearch is a point of a view, an attitude of inquiry or a frame of mind.It asks questions which have till now not been asked, and it seeks to answer them by following a fairly definite procedure. It is not a mere theorizing, but rather an attempt to elicit facts and to face them once they have been assembled. Research is likewise not an attempt to bolster up pre-conceived opinions, and implies a readiness to accept the conclusions to which an inquiry leads, no matter how unwelcome they may prove. When successful, research adds to the scientific knowledge of the subject.\n- Robert Robertson Rusk\nBoth Rummel and Rusk emphasize the dynamic and inquisitive nature of research, though they approach it from slightly different angles. Rummel highlights the historical evolution of research as a continuous quest for truth, framing it as a rigorous intellectual process aimed at discovering and verifying knowledge. In contrast, Rusk focuses on the mindset and procedural rigor involved in research. He emphasizes the importance of questioning established norms and being open to unexpected findings. This definition stresses that research is not just about affirming existing beliefs but about genuinely seeking new knowledge through systematic inquiry.\nTo be sure the best research is that which is reliable, verifiable, and exhaustive, so that it provides information in which we have confidence. The main point here is that research is, literally speaking, a kind of human behaviour, an activity in which people engage.\n- Francis G Cornell\n\nCornell, here adds another dimension by asserting that effective research must be reliable, verifiable, and exhaustive. This perspective emphasizes the credibility of research findings and their importance in fostering confidence. By characterizing research as a form of human behavior, Fourier highlights its collaborative and social aspects, recognizing that research involves interaction and engagement among individuals.",

The odds are very low at 0.00128, indicating a low baseline risk in the reference group.\nAge: With an odds ratio of 1.06 (95% CI: 1.05 to 1.06), each additional year of age is associated with a 6% increase in the odds of having diabetes, assuming all other factors remain constant. The confidence interval is narrow and above 1, suggesting a statistically significant effect of age on diabetes risk.\nBMI Category (18.5–24.9): This group has an odds ratio of 1.97 (95% CI: 0.707 to 8.21) compared to the reference category (presumably BMI &lt; 18.5). The CI is wide and includes 1, suggesting that this effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels. This indicates that adults in the BMI 18.5–24.9 category may have an increased risk, but this finding is uncertain.\nBMI Category (25.0–29.9): The odds ratio for this category is 3.28 (95% CI: 1.19 to 13.6), indicating that individuals in this BMI range have approximately 3.28 times the odds of having diabetes compared to the reference group. The confidence interval does not include 1, suggesting this result is statistically significant.\nBMI Category (30.0+): With an odds ratio of 8.08 (95% CI: 2.95 to 33.4), individuals with a BMI over 30 have over 8 times the odds of having diabetes compared to the reference group. The confidence interval is well above 1, indicating a strong and statistically significant association between a high BMI and increased diabetes risk.",

We began with simple linear regression, analyzing both continuous and categorical variables to understand relationships in straightforward contexts. We then expanded to multiple linear regression, enabling the examination of multiple predictors simultaneously and offering a more nuanced view of relationships. Finally, we introduced logistic regression for binary outcomes, which is especially useful in clinical research where dichotomous results, such as disease status, are common.\nThroughout the chapter, we not only developed a clear understanding of these models but also learned how to effectively implement and interpret them using R. These foundational methods provide a versatile toolkit for clinicians to address a wide range of research questions, laying a groundwork for further exploration into more advanced statistical modeling.",

    "text": "Credible research is essential as it forms the foundation for informed decision-making and policy development across various fields. When research is trustworthy, it provides reliable insights that can guide practitioners, stakeholders, and the public in addressing real-world issues.\nCredible studies enhance our understanding of complex phenomena, foster innovation, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge. Furthermore, they build public confidence in scientific inquiry and its outcomes, ensuring that findings are not only accepted but also utilized effectively for positive change. In an era of information overload, the importance of credible research cannot be overstated, as it helps distinguish between valid evidence and misinformation.\nIn the realm of research, Validity and Reliability serve as critical checks for ensuring its credibility. Together, these concepts form the backbone of robust research practices. In this session, we will delve into both validity and reliability in detail, exploring their definitions, significance, and the various methods used to assess them, ultimately highlighting how they contribute to the overall trustworthiness of research findings.\nWe will understand both the concept in detail in this session.",

    "text": "The one-sample t-test is a statistical method that compares the mean of a sample to a known reference value—usually a population mean—to assess if there is a significant difference. In this context, using the NHANES dataset, we can investigate whether the mean blood pressure (BP) of a sample of adults differs significantly from the standard “normal” BP value. For adults, normal BP is often considered to be around 120 mmHg for systolic pressure.\nHere’s how we can set up and conduct this test:\nHypotheses:\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): The mean systolic blood pressure of the sample is equal to the normal value (120 mmHg).\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): The mean systolic blood pressure of the sample differs from 120 mmHg.\nR Implementation: We’ll use the t.test() function to conduct the one-sample t-test, specifying 120 as the value for comparison.\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse)\n\n# Load NHANES data\n\n\ndf &lt;- NHANES::NHANES\n\ndf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\ndf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  mutate(bp_sys_post = case_when(\n    bmi &gt; 25 ~ round(bp_sys_ave + runif(n(), -8, -1), 0),  # Generate a new random number for each row\n    TRUE ~ round(bp_sys_ave + runif(n(), -2, 2), 0)        # Same for those with bmi &lt;= 25\n  ))\n\n\n\n# Filter to include only adults\ndf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(age &gt;= 18)\n\n# Conduct a one-sample t-test\nt_test_result &lt;- t.test(df$bp_sys_ave, mu = 120, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# View the result\nt_test_result\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  df$bp_sys_ave\nt = 3.6188, df = 7204, p-value = 0.0002981\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 120\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 120.3334 121.1215\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 120.7274 \n\n\nInterpretation of Results:\n\nt-Statistic: 3.618\nDegrees of Freedom: 7,204\np-value: 0.0002981\n95% Confidence Interval for Mean BP: (120.33, 121.12)\nSample Mean: 120.73 mmHg\n\nWith a p-value of 0.0003 (below 0.05), we conclude that the sample’s average blood pressure of 120.73 mmHg is statistically different from the normal BP value of 120 mmHg. However, for clinicians, it’s essential to think about what this small difference actually means for patient care.\nIn this case, while there’s a statistically significant difference, the 0.73 mmHg increase from the standard value is likely too small to have clinical importance. This reminds us that even if a result is statistically significant, it’s the practical impact on patient outcomes that ultimately matters.",

In a world increasingly driven by innovation and inquiry, the importance of ethical considerations cannot be overstated. This chapter will underscore the pivotal role ethics plays in shaping research practices, ensuring that the pursuit of knowledge aligns with moral values and societal well-being. By linking ethics to axiology—the philosophical study of values—we will highlight how ethical frameworks guide researchers in making decisions that reflect our collective values.\nWe will begin by exploring the etymological origins of the term “ethics,” providing a historical context that lays the groundwork for understanding its evolution. This background will include a candid examination of ethics’ darker history, where moral lapses have led to significant societal repercussions, reminding us of the necessity of vigilance in ethical considerations.\nNext, we will outline the core principles of ethics that are fundamental to research, followed by an examination of various ethical theories that inform our understanding of right and wrong. A key focus will be the differentiation between medical ethics and public health ethics, as each field presents unique ethical challenges and responsibilities.\nAs we progress through these topics, we will emphasize the critical importance of ethics in research, arguing that ethical integrity not only protects participants but also enhances the credibility and societal value of research outcomes. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the intersection of ethics and research, reinforcing the idea that ethical conduct is essential for fostering trust and advancing knowledge in our society."

    "text": "17.3 Paired t-test:\n\nTo examine the effect of an intervention, a paired t-test can be used to compare blood pressure (BP) measurements taken pre- and post-intervention among individuals with a BMI greater than 25. The paired t-test is ideal for dependent samples, where each individual has measurements in both conditions (pre and post), allowing us to assess whether the intervention significantly impacted BP.\nFor the paired t-test examining blood pressure changes before and after an intervention among individuals with a BMI over 25, the hypotheses can be outlined as follows:\nHypotheses:\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): The mean systolic blood pressure before the intervention is equal to the mean blood pressure after the intervention for individuals with a BMI greater than 25. This implies that the intervention had no effect on blood pressure.\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): The mean systolic blood pressure before the intervention is different from the mean blood pressure after the intervention for individuals with a BMI greater than 25, suggesting a potential effect of the intervention on blood pressure.\nIf the test results in a p-value less than our significance threshold (typically 0.05), we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in blood pressure, likely attributable to the intervention.\n\n# Filter the dataset for individuals with BMI &gt; 25\ndf_filtered &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  filter(bmi &gt; 25)\n\n# Run a paired t-test\nt_test_result &lt;- t.test(\n  df_filtered$bp_sys_post,\n  df_filtered$bp_sys_ave,\n  paired = TRUE)\n\n# Display the result\nt_test_result\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  df_filtered$bp_sys_post and df_filtered$bp_sys_ave\nt = -152.84, df = 4855, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -4.562935 -4.447361\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      -4.505148 \n\n\nPaired t-Test Results Interpretation\n\nT-Statistic:\n\nThe t-statistic is -155.16, indicating a significant difference in systolic blood pressure (BP) between the average pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements.\n\nDegrees of Freedom (df):\n\nThe degrees of freedom is 4855, indicating a large sample size, which adds robustness to the statistical findings.\n= P-Value:\nThe p-value is &lt; 2.2e-16, which is extremely low and suggests a statistically significant difference in systolic blood pressure before and after the intervention. Since this p-value is well below the standard threshold of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a meaningful change in BP levels. Alternative Hypothesis:\nThe alternative hypothesis states that the true mean difference in systolic blood pressure between the two measurements (pre- and post-intervention) is not equal to zero.\n\n95% Confidence Interval:\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is (-4.603987, -4.489094). This interval indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true mean decrease in systolic blood pressure lies between -4.60 mmHg and -4.49 mmHg. Since the entire interval is negative, this strongly supports the conclusion that the intervention has led to a significant reduction in systolic BP.\n\nMean Difference:\n\nThe average difference in systolic blood pressure is approximately -4.55 mmHg, suggesting that, on average, individuals with a BMI greater than 25 experienced a decrease of 4.55 mmHg in systolic BP following the intervention.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe results of the paired t-test indicate that the intervention was effective, resulting in a statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure among individuals with a BMI greater than 25. The average decrease of 4.55 mmHg is both statistically significant and clinically relevant. This finding underscores the importance of the intervention in managing blood pressure among this population, suggesting that similar strategies may be beneficial for further lowering systolic blood pressure and improving cardiovascular health.",
