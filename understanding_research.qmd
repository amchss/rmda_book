# Research: Etymology & Definition 

The goal of this session is to explore the origin of the word 'research' and to elucidate its definition..

## Origin of the Word 'Research'

The word research traces its origin to the *Middle French* term **rechercher** which translates to *search again*.

This verb is composed of the Old French prefix "re-" meaning "again" and "cerchier" which means "to search." Therefore, "research" originally conveyed the idea of revisiting or closely examining something.

## Defining Research

Research may be defined as the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing knowledge in a new and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies and understandings. This could include synthesis and analysis of previous research to the extent that it leads to new and creative outcomes.

Research is the cornerstone of human advancement, serving as a systematic inquiry that seeks to **uncover new information**, **validate existing knowledge**, and solve complex problems. Unlike other species, humans possess the unique ability to document and share their findings, creating a ***continuous thread of knowledge*** that connects past discoveries to present inquiries. This cumulative nature of knowledge is essential; each generation builds upon the insights of those who came before, allowing for profound advancements in science, technology, the arts, and social understanding.

Let us visit few definitions given for research by luminaries in the field.

-   Research is an endeavor to discover, develop and verify knowledge. It is an **intellectual process** that has developed over hundreds of years, ever changing in purpose and form and always **searching for truth**.

    **- C Francis Rummel**

-   Research is a point of a view, an attitude of inquiry or a frame of mind.It asks questions which have **till now not been asked**, and it seeks to answer them by following a fairly **definite procedure**. It is not a mere theorizing, but rather an attempt to elicit facts and to face them once they have been assembled. Research is likewise **not an attempt to bolster up pre-conceived opinions**, and implies a readiness to accept the conclusions to which an inquiry leads, **no matter how unwelcome** they may prove. When successful, research **adds to the scientific knowledge** of the subject.

    **- Robert Robertson Rusk**

    Both Rummel and Rusk emphasize the dynamic and inquisitive nature of research, though they approach it from slightly different angles. Rummel highlights the historical evolution of research as a continuous quest for truth, framing it as a rigorous intellectual process aimed at discovering and verifying knowledge. In contrast, Rusk focuses on the mindset and procedural rigor involved in research. He emphasizes the importance of questioning established norms and being open to unexpected findings. This definition stresses that research is not just about affirming existing beliefs but about genuinely seeking new knowledge through systematic inquiry.

-   To be sure the best research is that which is **reliable, verifiable, and exhaustive**, so that it provides information in which we have **confidence**. The main point here is that research is, literally speaking, a kind of **human behaviour**, an activity in which people engage.

    \- **Francis G Cornell**

Cornell, here adds another dimension by asserting that effective research must be reliable, verifiable, and exhaustive. This perspective emphasizes the credibility of research findings and their importance in fostering confidence. By characterizing research as a form of human behavior, Fourier highlights its collaborative and social aspects, recognizing that research involves interaction and engagement among individuals.
