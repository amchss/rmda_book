# Validity in Research

Validity is concerned with the integrity of the conclusions that are generated from a piece of research. 

## Main types of validity typically distinguished in research:

 - Measurement Validity
 - Internal Validity
 - External Validity
 - Ecological Validity

## Measurement Validity

The soundness or appropriateness of a test or instrument or it could be even an indicator to measure a concept, in measuring what it is designed to measure.

### Several Ways of Establishing Measurement Validity

 - **Face Validity**, reflects the content of the concept in question.It can be established by consulting experts to see if the measure accurately addresses the intended concept.
 
 - 

## Conventional Paradigms of Validity

 - **Internal validity** 
The best approximation of truth or falsity of a statement implying a relationship or its absence between two variables –indicative of causation.

 - **External validity** 
The validity with which we infer that the presumed causal relationships can be generalised to and across alternative measures of the cause and effect and across different types of persons, settings and times.

## Few terms in clinical resaerch

When discussing validity in clinical research, two crucial concepts emerge, **sensitivity and specificity**. These metrics are essential for evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests and measurement instruments, helping clinicians understand how accurately these tools identify the presence or absence of a condition.

## Sensitivity

Sensitivity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify those individuals who have the condition, also known as true positives. A highly sensitive test minimizes false negatives, ensuring that most individuals with the condition are accurately detected. This is particularly important in scenarios where missing a diagnosis could lead to significant consequences, such as in screening for serious illnesses.

## Specificity

Specificity measures the test's ability to correctly identify individuals who do not have the condition, known as true negatives. A test with high specificity reduces the likelihood of false positives, ensuring that those without the condition are not mistakenly diagnosed. This is crucial for avoiding unnecessary anxiety, further testing, or treatment for individuals who are actually healthy.

Together, sensitivity and specificity provide a more nuanced understanding of a test’s validity. They allow researchers to assess not only how accurately a test identifies true cases but also how effectively it distinguishes between those who have the condition and those who do not.
