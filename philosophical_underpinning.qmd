# Philosophical Underpinnings of Research

The pursuit of knowledge is deeply rooted in philosophical inquiry, shaping the very foundation of research. Understanding the philosophical underpinnings of research is essential for scholars and practitioners alike, as it informs the way we approach questions, interpret data, and derive conclusions.

Philosophy encompasses a range of inquiries into existence, knowledge, and values, each of which holds profound implications for research. By examining the epistemological, ontological, and axiological dimensions of inquiry, researchers can better appreciate the frameworks that guide their work.


## Few Fundamental Concepts and their Importance in Research

Research, as we stated earlier, is discovering and validating innovative approaches to investigate and comprehend reality. By investigating reality, we mean to understand its nature and to gather knowledge about the reality and make sense about the same. This understanding of research takes us to the philosophical concepts of ontology, epistemology and axiology.

### Ontology

Ontology is the study of being and existence. It concerns the **nature and structure of reality** and what entities exist in the world.

-   It was called **first philosophy** by Aristotle.
-   Origin comes from the Latin term **ontologia**, *science of being*.

In the context of research, ontology influences how researchers conceptualize the nature of the reality they study. For instance, a researcher may adopt an objectivist ontology, believing that a reality exists independent of human perceptions, or a subjectivist/constructivist/constructionist ontology, where reality is seen as socially constructed.

Broadly ontology may be divided into two, which is discussed below.


### Objectivist Ontology



## Epistemology

Epistemology is the study of knowledge, how we know what we know. It examines the **nature, sources, and limits of knowledge**.

In research, epistemological considerations affect the researcher's approach to acquiring knowledge. For example, a positivist epistemology emphasizes objective measurements and observable phenomena, while an interpretivist epistemology focuses on subjective experiences and understanding human behavior.

## Axiology

Axiology is the study of **values and ethics**. It explores what is considered valuable, including moral principles and aesthetic judgments.

In research, axiological questions in research pertain to the ethical implications of research practices and the values that inform the research process. This includes considerations about the impact of research on participants, the community, and broader societal implications.
